I ask parents and adult who wish to explore this product, to first make a free to play account, get into the Hall of Doom (especially) or the main Gotham or Metropolis global chat hubs and sit for an hour and just read the cesspool of remarks, comments and unrestrained commentry you read as it splashes across the chat channels for everyone (including your kids who do, or you may consider to play the game) and ask yourself; Do you really want your child to be influenced by this sort of content and participate in this sort of provocative dialect?  I've had the game for a fair few years and only recently in the last 2 months actually started playing the game and cannot believe the flamboyancy the players and community have no fear of any retribution or discipline regarding what is said or how in your face much of the talk you read publically for all ages to see.  What's more, the global chats and community will remain unrestrained as Daybreak human resources no not have any active moderators or staff to actually monitor these open channels and therefore any parents who either have children who play the game already, or are thinking about their children being exposed to this product, are being warned that this is what the community is like and, to be honest, log in yourself to explore and experience this yourself and manage your childrens social networking.  I have recently been suspended for a few days, my reason being I retaliated to one of these toxic community trash bodies who had decided to harass me after he and his league had booted me from a raid that had taken me 8 hours to queue for just out of spite because he had his league buddies in the raid and i was the odd one out.  I had done nothing at the time, got angry for being booted then did nothing further.  Around 24 hours later, I had a message out of the blue from this toxic body who decided to then troll, harrass and taunt me to the point where I retaliated in a private message to then have my account suspended.  I accept that I acted in rage and anger that this little cesspool had goaded me into losing my temper just because he felt the need to go out of his way to attack someone personally.  However, what makes me very angry is that the community for a long time now - i've noticed this on my return - that anything goes from language, sexual implications and racism, slurs and personal attacks and the Daybreak team no not enforce the public channels, nor monitor them, nor player conduct and leave reporting - if any - to the player.  Majority of the player base I believe know this and possibly don't report other players so that this direction of the downward spiral continues.  If you are a parent and DO have your kids play this product, or are considering, I suggest looking for yourself in regard to the chat channels and decide if this is the sort of environment you want to expose your family too. \u2026  Expand ", " Time for  DCUO 2..

Will they lose that prominent fanboy? Only time will tell, but this one is definitely gone.

Besides, how many MMOs that are currently available have the most cutting edge graphics, even on PC? I haven't tried any regulated PVP, but I have definitely dealt with the darker side of PVP being on a PVP server. Opposing factions will grief the hell out of you simply out of boredom (can only assume these are children playing or adults living in their parents house with a grudge against the world due to their lack of motivation to further their lives... because I sure can't imagine a reasonable adult would get any sort of enjoyment out of camping a low level area while they are at level cap just to see that toon get repeatedly two shotted and sent back to respawn).

Questing is pretty basic if you have ever played an MMO. A lot of \"go here and kill 20 of these\" type quests. The game uses your basic tank, heal, dps system while also involving a control role which so far seems to be movement altering or debuffing powers. It is cool to have some run-ins with known heroes and villains from the DC stables. It adds a level of comfort and familiarity in this universe. Combat is nice in that it gets away from the click and wait mechanics and instead goes with a more hack and slash, button mashing experience (perhaps button mashing isn't accurate since there are specific button combos that perform different attacks and abilities). So if you are looking for a game that will bring a new experience this may not be the game for you. If you are looking for another WoW style MMO but with a little more of an action combat system then this could be a great option. I personally take it in in small doses and it works well. A half hour or hour every couple days and I am content. I won't be couching this one and spending 18 hour stretches as I have in my younger years with more original MMO experiences. \u2026  Expand ", " best things : characters customization, flight, climbing, running like flash, team dungeons, scenarios in dungeons and instances, fights against boss like Metallo, Lex Luthor, Bizarro, Clay Face, Queen Bee, Gorilla Grodd, Pinguin, Poison Ivy, DoomsDay, Mr Freeze and many others, monitored quests (superman, batman, wonder woman), Playing iconic characters (Joker, Bane, double face and best things : characters customization, flight, climbing, running like flash, team dungeons, scenarios in dungeons and instances, fights against boss like Metallo, Lex Luthor, Bizarro, Clay Face, Queen Bee, Gorilla Grodd, Pinguin, Poison Ivy, DoomsDay, Mr Freeze and many others, monitored quests (superman, batman, wonder woman), Playing iconic characters (Joker, Bane, double face and others) in pvp, booster gold humor, NPC less : solo fights against normal mobs, regions in MMO (outside instances) are often the same, boring after a certain moment, too mush level and time consuming for armors upgrading, raid dungeons very difficult or need best armors level, craft, guild  Game play : 6,5/10, graphics : 6,5/10, back ground : 6,5/10, lifetime : 6,5/10, sound : 7/10, character customization : 8/10, flight : 7/10 \u2026  Expand ", " VERY GOOD - Hero or villain?

The ONLY way to play is through a subscription. Free-to-play is nonexistent. While you can start a game for free, the only way to progress past level 30 is by paying for DLCs or a subscription. IF you want a good character, you MUST pay for it. If you max out your characters level, which has become unbelievably easy to do as Daybreak attempts to get rid of some of the grind of leveling, you will spend countless hours, months, and years trying to attain skill points. The only way to get your skill points maxed is to join a league and have a dedicated group of players go through the same joyless content over, and over, and over. The graphics are substandard. It's shocking so many people pay for a game that visually looks as poor as DC does. The same physical expressions, the same visual power flourishes, everything is recycled. Even the maps! Instead of coming out with new maps, devs will recycle an old map with new paint on it (Titan's Island for example). When an NPC has dialogue, their mouth DOES NOT MOVE. This fact alone should show how far behind DCUO is with their graphics than most games, period. The game itself is very, very glitchy. I'm sure this has to do with the game engine (ForgeLight) which is highly understaffed and outdated. The broker glitches every...single...time...you use it. Large open world events (such as Doomsday spam, Starro spam, GR spam) WILL glitch once it reaches a certain amount of players. The culture is toxic from players feeling like devs won't give any updates of substance. Leagues are elitist and there are few players left in the game that would help new players for no compensation. I have seen tanks charge a premium fee just to run content with others. The trade/LFG/world chat is usually crude, full of profanities, racial/gender slurs, and gold farmers. Players offer to sell nude photos for actual currency or subscription fees in trade chat and the devs don't bat an eye. This is in stark contrast with other mmorpg's I've played that protect their game-economies and players with fervor. Every new DLC comes with cosmetic items that go for roughly $10 per item in the marketplace. There is a chance to purchase these items in the broker using gold, but be ready for some incredibly steep prices (a single aura could be $30 million to $50 million to upwards of $100 million if a feat is attached). I know Daybreak is trying to make the company profitable, and recently on PC, a \"lifetime\" subscription was offered at a rate of $300 with 4000 subscriptions available. They sold out in a couple of days, netting the PC side of DCUO with $1.2 million. This is after two rounds of layoffs cutting Daybreaks staff by a third in 2018. I respect DCUO for being cross-platform, however, this has presented its own challenges. If you look at the ranking system, the top three ranked characters for health would be low level PC players because they're hackers. Once again, this is something the devs do nothing about. I have personally seen a pc hacker go through the Doomsday raid in less than two minutes with no mechanics used. Pvp in DCUO is painful, as is the queuing process in general. After a two year break, I returned to DCUO and found...zero pvp updates. Wait, zero? Really? The last \"update\" to pvp was a higher tier of gear, so additional pvp griding is required but no new content and nothing to address why pvp in DCUO just isn't working. The active game population is dwindling. If you play for a couple of months, you will inevitably end up knowing almost every player that talks in chat. It might SEEM like a lot of characters, but most now are alts (I would estimate 1 out of 8 characters is an active player). I loved playing DC for many, many years. I spent a TON of money and time on this game. You make friends and meet new people, but everyone eventually leaves. It's a race to get to the top, but once you're there it's a boring grind. I wish whole-heartedly this game had evolved into something better, something graphically stunning, something with an engrossing storyline, but instead, it evolved to meet the monetary needs of the company and it shows in every aspect of the game. The best advice I have to anyone wanting to play DC is: never, ever, buy a DLC, pay for the subscription no more than 3 months in advance, try not to take it seriously, and the second you become uninterested, stop playing and move on to a new game. I hope that in the years to come, DCUO becomes so much more than it is now and players feel included and rewarded in their gameplay. \u2026  Expand "], "Total": 33, "Positive": "23"}, {"url": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/24200/DC_Universe_Online/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_3", "name": "DC Universe\u2122 Online", "price": "0", "platform": "PS3", "metascore": 67, "userscore": 7.4, "comments": [" This is a fantastic action/adventure MMOAG that should not be missed by anyone who's a fan of DC comics and open world game play, online or otherwise.

I did play a lot of Phantasy Star Online back in the Dreamcast era but the first version of that game was free to play. DC Universe is similar in the fact that its on a home console and it plays well with just a controller, but after your initial 30 days are up, you have to pay $15 a month after that. Console players are not used to subscription fees, even though Phantasy Star Universe and  Final Fantasy XI did charge them, the server population is low, it they are still up , in the case of PSU. So the question is, \"Is the game worth the $15 fee?\" I hope to give you enough information to decide that for yourself. The game starts you off with an excellent character creation menu, where you can have the same powers of some of DC greatest heroes or villains, or you can pick them from a custom menu. after that, you get to pick a mentor: Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman for heroes or Lex Luthor, The Joke, or Circe for Villains I picked plant powers, flight for my movement, and dual swords as my weapon type. I call him \"The Mulcher.\" After creating a character, you get sent to Brainiac's ship where you battle through easy enemies with the game explaining how to fight and use your powers. At the end you are assisted by either Superman or Lex depending if you picked hero or villain. the early missions and starting point are determined by your mentor. Then you start getting quests and it follows the route of a typical MMO, but combat is in real time. You perform combos on your controller to use special attacks once you unlock them from your skill tree as you level up, but the game just seems to end up being a button masher, also speaking of levels, the level cap is 30. You also also have to be level 30 to go on raids, which makes no sense to me. the only reason I play missions is to grind, not to be able to play more missions. After hitting 30, I decided to make another character, this time a villain with Fire powers and super speed, named \"Hot Sam.\" the game is a little different when you are a villain, but you often end up in the same locales playing similar missions. The game also seems a big buggy for a game that I had to download several software updates for. How big of patches, well a 135MB title update, then a 16GB install off the Blu-Ray, then a 2GB download from within the game. It took hours just to play it. I still get some major bugs. I've gotten stuck in debris, quests were not being registered as complete even though I completed them and watched the cutscene afterward and worst of all, crash bugs. If Sony Online Entertainment can get these bugs fixed, raise the level cap, and expand the game for no additional cost, then it will be worth the $15 dollars a month.

However the first time ou load up the game it does another download that took me 8 hours. Then I had to go through another 3hour update the next month. 2) Screen Size I first played the game on a small tv screen. This meant I couldn't see the text properly and had to either stand too close to the screen or refer to the wiki. I now have a much larger screen and no longer have this problem. 3) Combat The game is not like your standard RPG combat system as it revolves around combos and quick reflexes. This is perfect in a game trying to make you feel like a badass. To give yu an idea of this, one of the first powers you get on the gadget class Is the ability to throw a sticky grenade at enemies. 4) Charachter Customisation This is where the game really shines. So far my characters have been iron man, insane rich man in a neon green suit, guy from watch dogs and (my favourite) pink fat man with eyepatch and ginger Afro wearing a bongadge suit. Sadly most female Charachter look like they are auditioning for a wet shirt contest. 5) Mission Variety Sadly missions are just limited to kill *instert enemy*, collect *instert item obtained from enemy/ground*, interact with *insert some thing that goes away when you hold O* and fight *insert DC Charachter  It gets boring after a while. 6) Teams NEVER JOIN A TEAM UNLES YOUR WITH A FRIEND. I teamed up with someone and we both ended up with each others weapons that were supposed to help us. Now we both have a useless weapon and one that is too weak for the enemies we are fighting. \u2026  Expand ", " First Review!

Overall a very good attempt at bringing something new to the rather stagnant MMO genre. As an avid DCU follower, the thrill of having professional voice actors from their respective series giving you missions is something that honestly never wears off. If anything, much like a C&C game, missions will often come down to wanting to hear the next scripted sequence (or who will cameo next). For me, the game would have received a \"9\" but for two reasons. One is collision detecting. In an RPG that doesn't really matter, but for an action game where attacks can literally be dodged this game lacks. Similar complaints have been seen for MMOFPS'. Although points for trying. The second reason is the unreasonable pricing structure for Australians. They pay 25% more per month for playing, while the AU dollar is currently at parity with the US Dollar, there are no Oceanic servers and there is also no option to simply pay in US dollars (and let banks do the conversion). To me, that is beyond unacceptable, and perplexing why an MMO would cut out potential users when having an active community is what fuels most games of the genre. \u2026  Expand ", " I love this game its a very simplified and noob-friendly MMORPG.

Even though the raids and alerts are always the same they are always fun to do, especially in a fun group.

If you are accustomed to the normal point-and-click gameplay of most MMOs and do not like action games or open-world exploration, stay away from this because you will never see your mouse cursor while you are playing this. Now that it has gone free-to-play, there are bound to be some questions regarding disparity between paying and non-paying players. Most of the restrictions for a non-paying customer (free user) do not really affect gameplay much except the inability to receive items via mail and these items are sometimes equipment and emblems which you can collect for feats and also use as armour. As for the 1500 cash-on-hand limit, it isn't really an issue until perhaps level 30 since most items are not even gonna cost you 100+ in game cash (except auction house items which are super inflated as usual). At level 30, most players will want to buy the PVP armor which are earned with influence earned from PVP matches and since you don't earn cash there and you need to repair equipment (let's be honest..you'll die a lot), money will be an issue unless you do the quests or stock up on useless items in the bank at earlier levels to sell (seriously, do this). However, if you want to make life a little easier, you can upgrade to permanent premium status by paying at least USD 5 and the above restrictions will be removed with the cash-on-hand limit raised to 2000 or you can subscribe (legendary status) then there are no restrictions (no real need to do this unless you really love this game and wanna get rid of all the restrictions like number of characters you can create, dlcs, etc). This game can be played either in the PVP server or the PVE server. If you do not wish to be involved in open PVP (being killed without your consent) then join the PVE server and you're allow to switch between servers in game. However, in my opinion, one of the main fun in this game is the open PVP because of the nature of the game (action game), even if you have lousier equipment or lower level (of course not too drastic) than the opponent, you still stand a fair chance if you know how to block and interrupt your opponents successfully (this causes damage to them) or since this is open world pvp, you might win if you have the element of surprise. The graphics in this game is decent and good in my opinion but don't expect things like lip-movements while npcs talk. I also like the music in some instances like the last part of the tutorial. One of the negative things about this game is that it does not seem too much like an MMO. I soloed all the quests (excluding WANTED quest) from lvl 1 to 30 without much problems except the occasional ganking (players killing me) and thus there is no real need for me to group with others (until level 30 where there are raids and pvp matches which you can't solo). Of course, this is only my experience and the game does not stop you in any way from joining a party or guild at any time. In addition, due to the massive influx of new players, expect the occasional lag. Like all other games, you are bound to experience glitches like falling through the ground or getting stuck (you can solve these by warping to HQ of rally in map). The game also has a rather poor navigation system since only rally points show up in the map and you can't fast travel by clicking on a rally point and warp because the game will just teleport you to the nearest rally point and not the one you want. Furthermore, the layout of the watchtower for heroes is very confusing especially for newbies though eventually you will get the hang of it. The game is also meant for casual players so expect yourself to reach level 30 which is the max level in 2 days if you do all the quests given to you asap. There is not much content once you reach level 30 and have done all the story quest since all that's left is to get your armour through grinding PVP matches or PVE raids with other players. There is some replayability since most of the storyline and quests will be different if you choose a different faction or mentor on your next playthrough. Unfortunately, free users can only create 2 characters, 6 for premium and 16 for legendary (of course you can pay cash to increase this) when there are 6 different storylines (3 for hero, 3 for villain). In my opinion, this game is great as an action game maybe not so great as an mmo (the community's pretty nice and helpful though) and should be given a try since it is free-to-play. As for whether it's worth subscribing to, I leave it up to you since different people has different taste and budget (I didn't subscribe due to this). \u2026  Expand ", " All I have to say is I am impressed.

PvP has all the right parts (Arena's, Scenarios, Open World) but the combat is still more reminiscent of a fighting game such a street fighter than an MMO. There are blocks, block breakers, and interupts, all done with a combination of mouse clicks rather than hotkeys, at a speed that's more suited to fighting games or a CoD game than the more typically cerebral PvP of MMO's. The interface for the PC version is currently an exact replica of the PS3 version. Chat commands are limited, with /shout being the ONLY. Inviting or inspecting other players requires several layers of menu selections. In the end, while DCUO offers some out-of-the-box fun, it's the type of fun I could have in Co-Op or PvP MP in any number of games, without sufficient depth or variety to warrant it's subscription fee in competition with other PC MMO's. It may well be a hit on the PS3, given the lack of competition and streamlined combat and interface designed for that platform. Don't take this as a complaint about the Subscription fee - merely an opinion that, in a side-by-side comparison of other PC games asking for your monthly 15 dollars, DCUO does not do enough, well enough to get me to open up my wallet for it rather than another game. \u2026  Expand ", " This review contains spoilers , click expand to view .

I have yet to meet anyone who looks like my character except for people using the same colors and I've meet thousands of people in my 50 hours of play. The DCUO community is very friendly and joining a group is very easy. The gameplay is very addictive and there is hundreds of quests to do along with PVP game modes and other multi group activities. The choice of which mentor changes each playthrough in such a way that starting a new character with a different mentor and power changes the story and gameplay so much  that it feels like your playing a different game altogether. If your an MMO fan then you should at least try the game out and if your a comic fan then you should definitely get DCUO. It doesn't disappoint. The game has a few issues right now with some minor bugs but considering the scale of the game and the fact that its a new MMO I'd say in 3 months the game will be perfect from every point of few. \u2026  Expand ", " Overall this game is amazing, the combat flows, the customization is great and the story is fun and entertaining.

The customization at the beginning may throw some off because some categories feel lacking, but if you dive into the game and keep working your way through you will find 100s of different items for each category that are available to purchase or find. The combat works well with the PC, click combos are simple yet satisfying and the powers are flashy. There are two trees for every power set and each set will fall into a certain category like tank, damage and support. Each power tree has roughly 12 abilities that are all unique, which helps make only having 24 or so skills from each power set better. The melee combat flows and responds great. The different weapons really make your character unique especially if you pick a less used weapon like a rifle or bow. The cities are well thought out and are very large, each has a distinctly different feel. The game as does a good job of making you feel \"heroic\" when battling enemy heroes, some of the minor enemy heroes will be easy to fight and beat while others will push almost every players skill. Both the Super Heroes and Villains have a headquarters which are very large and accommodate everything a player needs, like a mailbox, bank, quests  and a lot of vendors which can be used to purchase more gear and styles to further customize their character. If I had to point out one glaring flaw in this game it would be the chat system. It is basic compared to other games and was clearly designed for the console. Its simplicity makes it hard to send personal messages to others and talking in league can be quite a chore sometimes. That is my biggest issue with this game so far, the servers have overall been very stable and have handled the demand well. When the servers do go down the Customer Reps almost always respond and let players know what is happening and try their best to provide accurate information about downtime. PVP is overall a fun and enjoyable experience but there are a few small balancing issues that should be worked out but overall does not kill PVP in anyway. Endgame content is not something I have explored in depth yet but overall I had a good experience at what I did accomplish and the promise of more free content for endgame PVE should satisfy most. I'd recommend this game to almost every MMO player out there or a die hard DC fan, there is a lot for both to enjoy. The combat is smooth and work great with the PC, the quests are deep and entertaining. The cities are amazing and offer a lot to explore while PVP adds a good spice to the game if your into that. People need to stop going into MMOS always comparing it to others. Yes, World of Warcraft is a powerhouse, but if you don't compare every aspect of DC Universe to WoW and take the game for what it is you will find a exciting adventure that will satisfy almost every style of player. \u2026  Expand ", " I'm quite impressed with DC Universe Online and Sony for stepping up their game.

And after trying out a few different combinations myself, I was able to find the combination i liked most. This is proof that every power is STILL different in some way from the others. Now back to customization. I have no idea why they're saying it's virtually a joke. How? I have yet to see ANY same character, and it's not like the customization ends after character creation. In-game, there are still different \"styles\" that each person can acquire. Also, the quests are likable. They are far less boring than normal MMO's, and if you do it with friends, it's even better!

Once you begin to level up the skill trees (and actually pay attention to your build) you see that there are very thoughtful combinations that you can pull off that are good for different circumstances. What does that mean? You get the action of a console game and the tactics of a MMORPG in one game. There were so many things that could have gone wrong with that approach (see Champions-Online) but SOE pulled it off. The story is great.

My dual-pistols character is a blast to play, and feels like he belongs more to me than Sony or DC because he is playing exactly how I pictured him.

The combat system is to be feels smooth, but can be a bit of a burden. With the combo system where you have to click the mouse buttons in succession and playing traditional MMOs, you may find yourself sticking to a few known combos while dissuading yourself from using the others. However, learning the combos can be enjoyable. The smooth combat system makes it possible to discern when to block or interrupt an attack; however, new players may be frustrated by PvP interactions when learning the combo system.  Although DC:UO is free-to-play, compared to other free-to-play games I have played, I found DC:UO more favorable to free players (except for the limitation of currency). Very few premium content flashes on the screen with the unfavorable \"look at all the content you are missing! Purchase the monthly fee!\" If you purchased a subscription and are no longer subscribing, DC:UO allows access to the content you subscribed to (i.e. light powers, unlocked unlimited currency). DC:UO store is filled with more cosmetic items than a buy-to-play setup.  PvP content is divided between regular PvP in which you use the character you have leveled to PvP and Legends in which you use iconic DC characters, such as Bane, with preset abilities but use the same weapon combos as regular characters. I personally prefer Legends, but new players may be dissuaded from joining because of the lack of familiarity they have with the Legendary character they choose.  PvE content is typical of standard MMOs with quests and dungeons. Dungeons can be queued for and you can pick which role you desire to play and the system will match players accordingly. However, the loot system is a pit different. Players in typical MMOs will go the body of the enemy and pick up the loot from there. DC:UO allows the loot to magnetize to the player along with orbs of XP and power allowing for a streamlined process for loot. Customization of one's character seems a bit limited compared to Champions Online. Champions Online allows any piece of an armor to be colored by a large palette of colors (I believe around 100 colors) with a max of four color slots per armor (although some pieces of armor may not use all four), but DC:UO only allows armor to colorized by a palette of three colors that you have chosen with a typical RGB slider. \u2026  Expand ", " Great idea for a game, and full of potential that went to waste at the end.

But once you reach end game, you find yourself with nothing else to do, literally. PvP was fun the first few weeks, then everyone left and the lack of reaction by SOE to merge servers and manage population balance killed that part too. The nail in the coffin was SOE's slow reaction (if at all) in fixing pressing issues, (not only bugs), adding new content and being involved with the community. The controls, due to the console porting, were mediocre, the interface was way too simplified at the cost of functionality, they never got around fixing the chat system correctly, and bunch of other \"small\" issues that overall contributed to push away their player base. Conclusion: A sad result to what could've been an amazing game. While fun initially and during the short leveling period, the game has absolutely nothing good to offer at end game.

Additions can be obtained to be able to hold more consumables or use more slots. That's called a utility belt. Camera isn't really an issue. If you are knocked back you can easily re-possition your view. You simply move your angle. A lot less grinding than other mmos. Newbie friendly.

This game's combat is completely skill-based, with such distinct weapons and powers I don't think I'll be getting bored any time soon. The weapons and powers each have their own play-style, finding a weapon or power to suit your own playing style isn't hard at all (if you have any trouble at all). Although the UI and chat is a bit clunky, these problems can be ironed out easily with addons in the future; I would've given it a 9 with these current problems taken into consideration. I've also heard some people complain about the controls but I haven no idea what they mean, I can target people just fine and haven't had any problems having attacks register. I can snipe specific targets during group pvp with spells and weapon attacks just fine. If you've played any kind of tps or fps before you should be just fine. The controls can be a bit foreign at first but I wouldn't say any more than any other action game. The game is simply beautiful with combat that flows so well, especially for such an action based mmo. There is an endless amount of customization, I haven't spotted any two players that look alike yet and I've been playing it since launch religiously on a full pop. pvp server.  I expected the  game to be plagued with lag and player teleporting when encountering a good number of people in the same area but, I was surprised and proven wrong. Often there will be 10+ players near a mission objective at any given time, you meet players of the opposing faction quite regularly during missions as the objectives will share a common location; it spices up pvp servers quite nicely.

I have seen how far that game has come and I was not expecting a game as great as WoW is off the bat. I am kinda getting over WoW and looking for something fresh but that has had enough time invested into it that it must be pretty decent. I was not expecting something as amazing as WoW but a game that could be updated and patched to be nearly as good eventually. However, I was expecting a game that in the very least offered a lot of variety and good controls and camera. Everyone who said to play it with a controller....BELIEVE THEM!!! Every chance I get to choose keyboard/mouse over a controller I take it. I am not a huge controller fan but man does the fighting suck in this game, when you are controlling the camera with your mouse movement, your character is being controlled with WASD, and at the same time your clicking like a mad man to attack. Now I'm fine with a lot of clicking but I want to see precisely where it is I am clicking. There is no cursor/pointer whatever you want to call it. Its just point your camera and point your character and hope you get lucky attacking who you indeed mean to attack. Another thing to note, if you have never played MMOs before you will be lost! Understanding basic questing is key to this game but there is no real tutorial on how to go about questing. Actually I don't think there was much of any tutorial on anything except fighting. To be good at an MMO you need to take advantage of all the tools offered to you; inventory management, character build, searching for parties, running instances, comparing items, etc. None of this is really touched on too much. Another thing to be prepared for if you haven't played yet. You are all expecting some amazing environment. Sorry its not as amazing as you think. the big cities like Gotham and such are the main places in this Universe and unfortunately they are pretty bland. You find a couple cool areas and the dungeons are a bit more detailed I guess but there isn't enough to please the eye. I'm sorry SOE but Blizzard has you beat on bad ass environments. Sadly the environment face lift that DCUO would need is too big of a change for a simple patch so if the game lives long enough one would still need to wait for an expansion to see any major changes. There are some positives however, for one it seems like a lot of people are playing which is good for the game to grow. More people playing means that SOE should show more interest on taking care of and maintaining the game. Another positive is the connection (at least that I've had) so far no crashes, lag, slow down, or anything like that. The graphics are pretty nice and the fighting though extremely clunky still looks cool. The main variety is in the character customization, you can make all sorts of combinations of characters. One thing I like (many others don't for some reason) is the limitation to a 3 color scheme to your hero/villain. You can pick and combination of 3 colors and use those colors on your characters however you'd like. This is really cool because it holds true to the classic DC characters that only had a few different colors that made them up. Another cool thing is the voice acting, well done, funny at times, not cheap and by not cheap I feel like the creators really tried to encompass the correct voices for the characters speaking. This includes little side characters too not just superman, batman, joker, lex, etc. Oh yeah the chat functions suck too but that could be a potentially easy fix. What I want to see in an update/patch/fix is the chat option improved and please give me a pointer/cursor and just have the camera follow my back unless I want otherwise!! OVERALL this game is going to come down to the care SOE and Warner has for it. They invested a lot of money and it shows. The base/core of the game is pretty good. The game would be a lot better with minor changes made. These changes are not impossible Sony so please listen to user reviews, we are the ones paying for this. If there isn't much improvement in the game I will not be playing long. There isn't enough about it to hold me in. Especially with my pocket draining each month.

Secondly, peoples tastes seem to run all over the place, so I'll preface this saying that my favorites have been EQ2, Guild Wars, Dungeons and Dragons Online, and Warhammer Online. Also, I'm by no means a fan of WoW, so take my opinion here for what it is. This game, on many levels, is simply fun. Not everyone will enjoy it, and nor will those that do do so the same amount. What's here, though, is an enjoyable, though far from flawless, melee and ranged combo system, and a shortened hotbar a-la guild wars. The melee combos are a far better alternative to the hotbar skillchains so many of us have gotten used to. Active blocking and dodging along with a variety of ranged attacks and powers make the combat here, though far from perfect, a much better alternative to the mindless skill rotations of so many mmos. I also want to point out that I feel the shortened hotbar of only 6 skills is a good thing for mmos. As interesting as it was dealing with 4, 5 or more hotbars in games like EQ2 and WAR and so on, I find it to be nearly as strategy focused having to pick out only 6 from a similar amount of options. Plus, with a limited power bar for these abilities, i'm spending near equal time attempting melee or ranged combos as I am working through my hotbar. The leveling in this game is fast. Really fast. I'm not the person hitting characters to cap left and right in MMOs, yet I managed to get my first character to 30 in just 4 days. That said, there haven't been too many MMOs I had as much fun with, and where I was equally excited to roll new characters and try out new specs. I was also impressed, though, with the amount of content once I hit 30 given how quick it was. Raids, Duos (2 person pve dungeons), Alerts (4 person), Arena PVP, Legends PVP (where you play as popular DC heroes/villains), open world PvP, Bounties (think FFXI's notorious monsters, though as DC characters, and not as tough), Daily quests, and all sorts of tokens and currencies to build up to unlock new gear. Also, for those that played CoH/Champions, you'll find the character creation lacking at first. Personally, I feel this is more than balanced out with the system for unlocking new armor pieces. Once your character has equipped an item, he is free from then on to use it as a style from the in game customization screen, whether or not he is still wearing said piece of armor. This has the lovely effect of actually making high end characters look high end, which I felt was missing a bit from CoH and much more so from Champions. PvP is fun but hectic, and while the PvP servers are a blast to play on, I don't recommend it for the weak of will. Quest areas will almost always be populated with both heroes and villains, usually working for opposite sides in opposing factions. While this is fun, it becomes difficult if you're trying to solo there. On PvE servers, though, this is just a blast. The world seems alive, where NPCs aren't just sitting around waiting to be killed, and heroes and villains are both running amuck, and you feel connected when you're battling against a pack of cops, and a hero swoops in to attack the joker's goons that were helping you out. The last thing I wanted to comment on was the story/presentation. Generally fantastic, with some high tier voice acting almost all around for the central DC characters. As a person entirely disinterested in the DC universe, I still found myself enjoying all of the heroes and villains MUCH more than I expected. Voice overs accompany every quest in the game, along with helpful map icons, to ensure you never actually have to read anything... I'm not sure if this is a good thing, but it certainly drew me in to the story more. The generic npc voice overs, though, are about as terrible as one would expect from an mmo, so don't get your hopes up there. tl/dr: fun but unpolished combat, quick leveling, a lot to do, great story, and an immersive world.

The PvP system works, except it is so unbalanced that most people just won't bother touching PvP. PvP matches are scatter with glitches, bugs and more repetitive gameplay. I will be fighting the same leveled players, but they will always manage to take me down in 2-4 hits but 10 hits from me won't take down half there health. For Fun Factor, this game has none. All you can do in this game, and I mean the only things you can do in this game is Fight, Fly or Run around the City and go from quest to quest and do PvP events. The camera is the thing that pisses me of the most, it stuffs up half way through combat only to make you die. The boss fights suk. All the bosses I fight will keep on doing Ranged attacks and constantly move away from me so I cannot attack them, and when im on very low health they get in for a melee kill.

The two major cities are beautiful, the character models show a lot of polish considering every piece of visual gear looks slightly different on any of the 6 different body types and ,unlike WoW and some of the other MMOs referenced in previous reviews, almost every visual item has a model of it's own rather than a texture applied to your base character model.  Add to that the use of normal mapping on the ones that are just texture-slapped-on-your-character-mesh and they still look varied and appealing.  I'm going to bring up another interesting fact: this game actually has physics based attacks that genuinely affect game-play. I'm not talking about the standard pull-towards and push-away skills, I'm talking about dropping a meteor on someone's head then being able to pick it up and throw it at them again while it respects gravity, object collisions, environment collisions, and player collisions as it should. Hell, you can use mental powers to throw around environmental objects like barrels, crates, and electronic equipment at other players or even the players themselves. These are things that people are used to seeing in action games and therefore take for granted. This is a VERY rare trait in an MMO.  There are a few problems with the UI, though fewer than games like Aion and WoW had at launch, and the keyboard controls do take a tiny bit of tweaking, though I only had to rebind the \"fast movement\" key from numlock to left alt to be right in line with what I'm used to.  To further address the issues people have been bringing up:  There's this wonderful little \"mouse sensitivity\" slider, imagine that, that fixes all the \"mouse control sluggishness\" issues that people are complaining about.  There's this nice little advance options menu under the \"options\" button on the launcher, WOW what an innovation, for fine-tuning your graphics, control, sound, and voice-chat settings. There's this wonderful little thing called \"Tabbed Targeting\" that puts a nice little cross-hair on your target to let you know where you're going to shoot, and when you aren't actively targeting someone, but are in combat, there's a nice little cross-hair in the center of your screen when you aim at someone you can attack.

Pick Batman and you'll start in a heroes hub in Gotham.  Pick Lex Luthor and you'll start in a villains hub in Metropolis.  There are two factions in DCUO, villains and Heroes and when you are roaming the central cities (Gotham and Metropolis) you are able to freely engage in combat with the opposing faction.  This is where the game truly shines.  When you create your hero you have 3 choices in movement style: Flight, Acrobatics, and Speed.  All 3 have their perks and are a blast to use to move around the main cities at a good pace.  Flying around buildings and under bridges, chasing or running from, enemies is simply a blast.  The next best asset of DCUO is the character creator which is robust and diverse.  You can truely make your own, unique hero.  Combat in DCUO is fairly engaging, with combos and a huge stable of styles and moves.  Each class has separate skill trees that can be pursued to shape your style of play.  One of the more unique aspects of DCUO is that when you find loot (in the form of weapons or armor) and you equip it, you forever unlock that visual style of the piece for your character.  There are two tabs to control your character's inventory and style.  While whatever you have in your inventory is what gives you your stats, your style tab determines how you look.  Got a new helmet, but love how your old one looks? That's not a problem in DCUO, go to your style tab and each armor peice will have a drop down box where you can select from any of the styles you have previously unlocked.  This allows your champion to stay in character.  DCUO is a pretty good looking game and is well optimized.  It controls fine with mouse and keyboard, but I prefer to use a controller to play.  The control scheme transfers well to controller, due to the game also being available on the PS3 and I find that it gives it more of an action feel in the gameplay.  Pretty much everything has voiceover audio, and it is performed well enough.  The stable characters (Batman, Superman, Joker, etc.) are all done by their regular actors from the cartoons and they do a great job.  The level cap is fairly low and you'll reach the \"end game\" pretty quickly.  Since you are not required to pay for the time you play, DCUO doesn't bother to waste your time with hundreds of grind quests.  Instead, DCUO has a robust end-game that includes several different forms of pvp and pve.  This is how Sony expands DCUO with content as well.  Instead of raising level caps, expansions come in the form of new movesets/powers that you can use when you create a character and new regions in the form of instances.  The core of the game is all there to play for free and I never felt that I \"had\" to buy anything.  I have purchased three expansion packs that gave me light, electricity, and earth powers, along with new instances.  These packs were all priced at $10 each, however, there are frequent deals running where you get bonus \"Station Cash\" (what you use to purchase items from the in-game store) or items will be discounted.  I used these sales to purchase $30 of station cash for only $10 and then I was able to buy two of the expansion packs for 50%.  So in all, I have purchased 3 expansion packs, two additional character slots, and still have station cash left for merely $10.  Well worth it.

Also, those kinds of games don't have any depth in creating a unique build for your character. DCUO possesses this trait, and there is so much customization into your attacks/powers that you'll be tinkering around with the Re-Spec chamber more than you intended to. Speaking of customization, when creating your character, you've got quite the palette. It's not a full blown every-miniscule-detail customization engine like Champions Online where you can adjust eyebrows, but enough to give you a unique character in both appearances and traits. I also like that you can switch roles which is like switching between skill sets best suited to what you want to do, adjusted just the way you like it. If you're a healer, you can switch between Healer or Damage roles and modify the skill set to best adapt to situations you're going to get into. A big plus about this game is the level cap. While most would complain about the level 30 cap, It's actually a huge plus so you can experience the endgame content quicker which there is plenty of, especially if you have the DLC packs or a legendary account.

It's not the kind of PvP where the best gear wins you the fight, but you have to play strategically in order to decimate an opponent. That is what makes this game shine.

It really is all about how you play, which Guild Wars also had, and that game's PvP has to be the best I've ever played.  Another thing they got right with DCUO is the loot system. You just hold a button and the loot comes to you. Something so simple yet so many MMORPGs missed when implementing loot systems. Now, as far as free accounts go, you get the vast majority of the core game. You can play all the way to the game's level cap, do different PvP modes, etc etc. That is all part of the free account. Some drawbacks are that you can only carry $1500 at one time, or that you can't access the DLC. Also, the auction house will be useless to level 30 players on a free account since items are inflated far beyond $1500. You have 2 further tier upgrades for your account, the first being premium, which you can buy the DLC seperately and have it permanently activated on your account. Then there's legendary account, which unlocks absolutely everything about the game. Unlimited cash on hand, all DLCs are available, among other perks.  If you're asking me if having a subscription is worth it in this game, I would have to say yes, but only if you enjoy it as much as I do. This game has so many pros and very few cons that I wanted more out of the game, so I upgraded to a legendary account. I'd rather pay a subscription to this game than some bland, generic MMORPG like WoW or Aion. I find nothing entertaining in those games, where you auto attack, have 3 rows of spells that total over 20 spells at once, casting them over and over. I'll never understand why people are so attracted to that model that WoW set for other developers to copy.  But yeah. I love this game. There's enough content to keep me entertained for a good while, and they're putting out DLC every 3 months. I say play it. This is an honest review from me and not some hate spewing text block that people put because they can't understand the game. \u2026  Expand ", " AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Google \"dcuo forum the current prestige cap isn't going to work\" the green name on the third page of the thread to see the way he manages the community he was hired to manage. \"Be care what you wish for...\" and he made good on that threat, the very next game update addressed the issue at hand in the most sadistic way imaginable.  The devs used to know what they were doing, but recently they've been adding boring and monotonous game mechanics that cater to three-year-olds and then the devs (especially the current creative director) openly insult their customers in the game's forums. Every week they make a new decision that is a deal breaker for people who used to be fanboys of the game.  If you start playing it and you enjoy it, it will be a completely different game within a year. If you decide to pick it up and you love the game, the question in the back of your head should be: How long until they introduce my deal breaker to the game? Because players that were at one point the biggest supporters and fanboys of this game are now leaving en masse (I used to love this game and said many times I'd be playing this game till the servers shutdown). Right now the universally decided most obnoxious fanboy is fuming about the most recent changes, other forumites are trolling him reminding him of how he previously always said the devs are always right, and telling him he could never make good on his threat to quit the game because he has previously proclaimed that his league is like family and he loves them.  Check out the dcuo forums and I can almost guarantee you'll see long time players begging the devs not to introduce some bull crud mechanic that will destroy the fun of the game.  The game is buggy and you disconnect a lot, but for a longtime I convinced myself that all games will be buggy and glitchy and kick me out from time to time, it's the willful decisions that the devs make to dumb down the game and their constant underestimation of their players' intelligence and skill that got me to quit playing what was my favorite game for two years. \u2026  Expand ", " First off this game is more MMO action game than RPG.

I could go on forever with what the game has done wrong (like the journal updating and emptying your quest tracker or the fact that when I talk to an npc I have to go into my journal and see what they said to actually accept the quest), but find very little to comment on what the game did right.

Another important point : I did too few PVP so I won't talk about it. So let us start by the technicals. Registration (important for MMO) : without a hitch. I see the one and two glitch reported , but it was smooth for the crushing majority of people.  The launcher do not do a great job to show you how far you are (it only give you a number like 6.9 Gb out of 8.7 >Gb, but does not say anything about speed or how long it will take at current speed).  But otherwise it is OK. Disclosure : my max Char level is 15 among 4. I have played since the 14th and it is today the 18th. Sound : voice acting is nice, corny at time, but that is *expected* rather than unwanted.  The sound effect average, but OK enough for dungeon romp. the music is quite disturbing to play OTOH. Graphic : The model are good but not really great. You won't be paying too much attention to them in the heat of action. The environment are bland and a tad bit repetitive by zone, but change from zone to zone, while still staying urban (high rise zone, industrial zone, university zone , small shopping district zone, Chinatown zone etc...). I think the graphic are good enough, but do not offer much (up to level 15) difference. Speaking with a level 30 gave me the impression this stay the same all the game long.  Not many option there, and unless you release vsynch, you are limited to 30 fps, and you have to trick around to add AA, but frankly that did not disturb me. As said, good graphic, but far away from being tip top hi tech. Gameplay : button smashing. Sure there are combo you can do, but up to level 15 by mixing restore, health gain power, and 2 interrupt/blocking break skill you can deal with nearly all the PVP content. I tried a few of the combo to see if it made a difference, and it sure did, but OTOH the fact that you have to remember half a dozen combination of tap and hold make it easier for people to use mostly 1 or 2. Sure I betcha I would get killed in pvp over and over, once people learn to combo and combo break, but come on. Tap 9 time then hold ? What the heck. Remind me of mortal combat.  Content get repetitive in mission. Kill 20, gather 10, kill 15, repeat and rinse. Thankfully the story (if you pay attention to it) is stopping the gameplay to think too far.  Anyway probably my own fault for finding the combo system too complicated. but buyer beware. There are a lot of common quest line, but the 6 sets of different power give replaybility.  And two side, villain and heroes. OTOH you level pretty damn quick, I am a few day in and i have 3 level 10 char and 1 level 4 (I tried different power set, fire, ice, nature, and sorcery).  The main problem is that the gameplay is always the same, and the quest don't seem to be different at level 1 or 15, only the mob level. Character creation :  average at best. There is no much allowed except different skin and hair, and 3 sizes. Otherwise you pretty rapidely see people use the same combo. For example be it male or female with a rock skin, if you cover it all with a spandex, and a mask , that does not make sense. So most people with a different skin go with clothing showing that skin off. So I see a lot of dupes outside. UI: bad. Baaad UI. *Whack UI with a rolled paper journal*. Chat window is small and as far as i can tell not resizable. kiddy filter FORCED to be on, and it does a bad job at it. For example \"about it\" get censored, because filter ignore space and see TIT. Bahhhh. Can't assign more than 6 powers. If you want to use 6 differents, you have to use the clunky UI to reassign, you can't \"save\" different action bar there is only one. No interraction I could find like /bow , /curtsey, but maybe I missed it because the FORCED tutorial (not skippable) do a good job teaching you 2 or 3 basic then throw you out in the boiling water without explanation. POWER are very badly explained and result is sometimes surprising and make you regret having choose it. And i pass many other flaw. I am slowly running out of character so I need to conclude. At the moment the game is limited in gameplay, and end content is reported to be limited (by level 30). Don't expect much more than a few week content for 1 char from 1 to 30. Environment repetitive quest repetitive. if you are a DC fan, maybe this game earn a good 7.5 out of 10. If you are not, this game don't earn much better than a 5/10. In a way CO had a lack of content and end content like this game, but it allowed a MUCH much greater customisation and varied gameplay. If they add content/repair UI for PC, it might get a 6/10.

However, DCUO has kept myself and my girlfriend thoroughly entertained for hours now. There are so many choices when customizing your hero/villain, that I have yet to come across any two heros or villains that are alike. The quests are unique, and relate to the story... even side quests! It's awesome to fight with/against popular DC characters, and for the most part the voice acting is superb, with many favorites returning to reprise their roles (Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamil as the Joker, etc). I really like the idea of having multiple roles you can switch between, each with their own customizable power loadout. I played as a magic character, and while using my damage roll my abilities will do damage or provide damage buffs. However, if I switch to my healer roll, the same powers will heal or provide defensive buffs. It's a cool idea, and makes the game all that more flexible. I also like the ability to hide all gear that you wear automatically, allowing you to always look like the super hero or villain that you initially created. Many players will spend tons of time making their MMO character, only to have them hidden under ugly armor that is statistically superior. Not so in DCUO. As a final note, I want to mention that I strongly suggest using a gamepad (I'm using an Xbox 360 controller) to play this game- even if you're normally a mouse and keyboard player. This is a beat-em-up brawler styled game, and it's quite hard on your mouse and fingers if you play it that way. You'll notice that, unlike every other MMO, you don't have a mouse cursor during gameplay to click on abilities or other objects. The mouse is only used for targeting and looking. This game was obviously created for the PS3 first, and not the PC, which some may see as a bad thing. All my worries of this development choice were instantly set aside the moment I picked up a controller to play the game. It's easier to play, and the controller preset is surprisingly good. All in all, as two people (my gf and I) who don't play a lot of MMOs or follow super hero lore, we are having a blast, and looking forward to every moment we get to play together. Obviously there is plenty of room for improvement in things like the chat and friend system, but the core gameplay is fun, and the quests are interesting and varied. I'm playing as a villain right now, and I can wait to start up a hero to play through that content as well! \u2026  Expand ", " DC Universe Online brings an exciting, dynamic, and innovative combat system to the MMO genre that has been plagued with the stale and generic \"point-and-click\" borefest for too long.

I guess I should quantify P2W, since there are MANY definitions.  P2W by my definition is the necessity to pay in order to compete in either PvP or PvE.  To have access equipment, powers, or gameplay that imbalance the game in such a way that you cannot be successful without spending money.  While you DO have to spend money for certain powers or gameplay access, it is not dependant upon your success.  You can do equally well playing in the full F2P basic access to powers as those who are full subscribers.  There are also DLCs to purchase, but they also are not required to enjoy the game, although that does leave content a bit sparse.  Not spending ANY money on the game makes it a grind fest, so throw them a few bucks (if you enjoy a game, give them SOMETHING).  Doing so will get you at least a few perks, like 4 more character slots, 50% more inventory space, 100% more bank space, 5 auction slots, and a third more max cash.  Know that cash limitations are for gold selling.  Don't complain about it.  It's an unfortunate reality of MMOs with Freemium/F2P monetization models.  Given all this, I'll caution you away from the subscription model (this is one of the head scratchers).  There really is no point in it.  They are not releasing content fast enough that having a sub makes it worth it.  You will spend significantly less not going with a sub.  And that even means accessing your cash escrow regularly, which costs money.  As for gameplay, it's quite fun and the missions, while typical, at least vary enough and well executed enough that you don't mind them.  Character customization has not been exploited as you might expect.  There is very little in the game store for you to purchase.  90% of the costumes are available in game, although as of Amazon Fury I, some equipment styles have been tied to the DLCs.  So far that's only 15 suits and 3 weapon total.  It's likely that will grow as the game progresses.  If you are in the know, you might say that it is P2W because the advanced tier equipment is only available if you buy certain DLCs.  Not quite.  Without buying those DLCs, you wouldn't have access to the missions to need to get that equipment.  All the PvP gear remains unconstrained by anything other than time spent grinding PvP.  Also, know that you will have to pretty much have to follow builds to compete.  There will be no \"theming\" of your powers.  If you don't follow preset builds, you are handicapping yourself to the point that you may not be able to complete storyline missions.  It happened to me with my Gadget themed hero.  Almost made me give up the game until I read up on some builds.  Used the build and aced a mission that I couldn't get through without dying.  REPEATEDLY.  Unfortunately it goes COMPLETELY against how I wanted my character themed, but it's one of the things I marked off for the game.  The other head scratcher is the penchant to favor the heroes in this game.  It's MUCH easier to be a hero than a villain.  Wany things are easier (NOTE: not impossible), if you are a hero.  From not getting shot down during a race (happens on both sides, but is more prevalent for the villains) to getting all your achievements.  As someone who favors the bad guys in a game, this is a bit of a let down.  You will be significantly more frustrated by being a villain.  I guess that's what gives us our bad attitudes.  I suppose if it weren't hard, some parents group might get on a campaign against the game.  As for the community, there are some helpful, quite a few not so helpful, and a few downright rude people.  Not unusual for a F2P/Freemium community.  Just know that if you are a noob to the whole MMO thing.  There will be some hostile remarks to inquiries and rude ones if you need actual help with missions.  This isn't going to be one of the best MMOs, but it will be fair and fun.  Give it a try.  It's not like it isn't free to do so. \u2026  Expand ", " Time for  DCUO 2..

Now with FF XIV, Neverwinter, ESO, and Skyforge, there's a lot of console MMOs to choose from. For me, this game s the best of these titles.  The game can be enjoyed absolutely free, except if you go this route, you'll reach the end of the content in a week or two. You can buy expansions individually for about $5 each -- yes they're short, but they're also always coming out. New content is always just around the corner, and each has plenty to do.  If you choose to subscribe, you'll get everything you could ever want for $15 a month, or $120 for a full year. Free expansions (as long as you keep your sub active), full bank and inventory space, all power sets (classes), tons and tons of value -- plus enough in-game currency to unlock cosmetics.  The combat uses a limited action set (about 8 skills per loadout), and uses a rock-paper scissors style combat system very similar to what ESO offers (but DCUO came out first). Light attacks, heavy, blocks, stuns, it's pretty in-depth and fun.  Every class is equally good at dealing damage, but each class also has access to one 'role' (besides dps). Some power sets are tanks, some are healers, and others are 'controllers'. Controllers are pretty unique and my favorite role. They do a few things -- they generally are responsible for being 'mana batteries', restoring power to their team so they can use their powerful skills more frequently, like a healer but for mana. They also function as crowd control with stuns etc, and in mechanics heavy fights, generally it's best for the controller to 'do the things' (pull the lever, hack the console, etc) while the tank, healer, and dps keep fighting.  Leveling is quick. The cap is 30, and you can hit that in a week or less. I personally like that I can have a max level hero pretty quick -- starting over in Warcraft and looking at a 150 hour slog to get to 'relevant' content, or worse, LotRO's 300+ hours is daunting. This game respects your time. Once you hit level cap, the gear treadmill starts like most MMOs. There are currently 27(!) expansions each adding new raids, new zones, and often a new gear type (side-kicks, utility belts, lairs, etc).  I don't play much PvP but it's pretty solid for those who enjoy PvP. There's a ton of pre-made heroes with unique skill sets that you play as in PvP -- instead of using your own created heroes and villains, you play as Batman and the rest. The active combat makes 'ring psychology' and learning your opponents' habits critical. It's about predicting their reactions while remaining as unpredictable as possible.  The level-capped solo experience is bar-none top notch. There's a ton of things to discover and collect, 'skill points' earnable for a staggering range of activities, you will never run out of things to do or ways to improve your character, and unlike games like Neverwinter, improvements never take more than a few minutes. It's this fast pace of improvement that lends itself to 'just one more quest' mentality and make it hard to put down.  If you haven't played before, or if you wanted to like it but didn't years ago, I'd encourage anyone to see what it's got going for it today. \u2026  Expand ", " Its a love-hate relationship you'll have with this.

Character creation isn't too horrible if your planning to play only vanilla, but unless you shill out for the powers, which are by far better than the originals then you generally won't have a hope of winning in future story DLCs/PvP.  The thing I despise are the story DLCs that emerge costing ~$15.00 everytime. It's good that there is fresh content being released regularly but the fact that you continue to pay for a storyline over and over again are a deal breaker for me. Reason is you cannot get the next tier gear say T4 without it. The consequence is that if you skipped a few DLCs you'll either have to pay for the skipped DLCs to play gear catch-up or make sure you have a team who will carry you through the latest missions.  This is definitely fun, and I was among an original adopter of this game (PS3).

RAIDS are a freaking blast, unless you get with alot of newbies who dont know the game much. But you cant play raids until you are high in CR(Combat Rating) ratings. But heres the downside. Several times since DCUO started, DCUO decided to change things. Everytime they did, my characters went from being mighty to start all over again. That sucks because you put alot of time, money, and wear out controllers playing this game. One time DCUO did this and many many people left and never came back.(2013) I almost left then myself. This game wants you to buy legendary membership. Because if you dont, you wont be able to get past CR95. So this is something newbies need to know. If you are not going to become legendary, heres what you will experience as I have. If you are a hero character, you should be able to reach level 30 almost without help. For Villians its harder. After you get to level 30, the on duty scenerios are also like that. The Villians seem to have more enemies and have a tougher time. Once you get to CR43, you are given the cat woman and penguin missions. They claim to be rated CR43 but once inside the enemies are CR53. Good luck. I have worn out many good controllers trying to beat these two missions. Right now I am trying to level up a character on my pc and I cannot beat either mission. Trouble is both are single player missions so you cannot get help. These missions wont give you anything to level you up either. They give you junk you cant use for a reward for fighting. They want you to buy membership so bad! If you somehow find a way to level 53, you have it made because then you can do old gotham and a couple other missions and rank up high enougfh to play raids, which give you alot of goodies. But its that area from level 43-53 thats a real pain in the control pad. They have a \"broker\" where you can buy things, but only if you are premium members. You become premium if you purchased something on DCUO. I have bought alot of things, but no legendary membership so Im still on the back burner. Anyways, in the Broker only legendary people can but things over 2000 dollars.. Everyone else is limited up to 2K. To make it bad, the legendary members make it even worse by selling their crap over 2000 each time. I wonder if DCUO provokes then to do this? This game can be fun at times, or it can aggrivate you so bad youll break your controller.  DCUO started making things alot harder because some rich players made it to level 165 with their legendary memberships, wanted to go back and play the lower levels, and griped to DCUO it was too easy (DUH!!) so DCUO caters to them instead of the general public. ( a level 43 mission and the player who is CR165 thinks its too easy) From what I read, DCUO is about to shaft themselves again making it to where the CR (Combat Rating) doesnt matter anymore. Once again ,they are going to strip away high levels of their power and make them start over. Not me. 3rd times the charm.
