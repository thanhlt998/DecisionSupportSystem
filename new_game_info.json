After many hours of playing this is my honest review. Tech: Graphic engine is smooth with 60fps, but looks aged due to lack of HDR lighting and some awful pseudo-reflections. Sound FX are above average. Controls are nearly perfect. Net-code works well after several patches. Art: Music, although generic, is very good. I bought MW2 on release day and I enjoyed it much... in the beginning. After many hours of playing this is my honest review. Tech: Graphic engine is smooth with 60fps, but looks aged due to lack of HDR lighting and some awful pseudo-reflections. Sound FX are above average. Controls are nearly perfect. Net-code works well after several patches. Art: Music, although generic, is very good. Scenarios are beautiful and detailed, although they suffer due to engine's lack of contrast. Good smoke and debris effects. Poor rain effects. Some models, like cars', are pretty bad. Weapons models are very detailed. Animation is above average. Story writing is epic but not very inspired and lacks cohesion. Game Design: Player character moves insanely fast. Weapons have very little recoil. Bullets make severe damage, you can kill fast as well as die. Campaign: It is very short and linear, and the length is mainly due to the insane amount of enemies you will encounter. Sometimes you may even think there are infinite of them (like in favelas levels). There are some breathtaking levels, only stained by the \"9999 enemies\" design decision. The story lacks cohesion, which means you forget about the relations between chapters, and you won't care about the story until the end. Spec-Ops: They are a set of cooperative short missions, mainly based on moments from the campaign. They're hard but fun to play with a friend online or split-screen. Unfortunately, it feels half-cooked and leaves you wondering why they didn't implement a full cooperative campaign. Online Multiplayer: Here is where most of the people wanted to come. Multiplayer is incredibly deep, fast and addictive. MW2 has a good set of modes and maps and a HUGE set of perks, killstreaks, tags, etc. You will have much fun for the first 50 levels or so, which is not too bad. I said it is addictive but it is also becomes frustrating and eventually boring. This is because unbalanced weapons and perks, loads of campers, lack of team play, huge bullet damage, God-like ninja knifers, annoying overpowered choppers and bizarre speed of movement. In the end, it becomes \"run in circles and knife anybody you come across\", which is a pity after the great amount of (unbalanced) options devs made for the game. Ending comment: MW2 has great production values and tons of content, but in the end, is very arcade. It rewards reflexes over skill and it gives you much fun quickliy, until you burn it out and it quickly becomes boring. Rent it and get Bad Company 2 or MAG if you want long lasting fun and develop your skills rather than your time of reaction. 7/10 …  Expand ", " Okay - first off I don't think this game deserves a 10: but the average score here is WAY off.

The whole gamut. No drivable land vehicles unfortunately, though. Realism = A bit to be desired here, to be honest. The single player just doesn't feel realistic enough, given the setting. At least enemies and allies are all subject to the same unrealistic levels of health. No destructible environments - which is a real shame. Sound = Ticks all the boxes Multiplayer (normal) = Styled like the standard fare of FPS, but more polished than than almost all others. This actively rewards skill, whilst goes out of its way to prevent frustration. Buggy peer to peer networking is quite unacceptable, though. Also, a larger maximum number of players would be nice. Multiplayer (co-op) = The fact that you must arrange these with friends can be a drag, and also the fact that the maximum number of players is 2. Also a very long scenario (like the Nazi Zombies of COD 5) would be greatly appreciated Single player = The gameplay is too linear and the player is unable to make any plot decisions - but that's the same with almost all FPS games. The AI is top-notch; shame you don't get to see it do more, though. Single-player is a tad short and has no co-op capacity. …  Expand ", " This is the first Call of Duty game I played.

I really enjoyed the single player on this one but was still not without fault.  I think they were trying to go for a big blockbuster kind of game but for me to be a blockbuster you have to have everything, and to me it just feels like this game was trying to take itself too serious and were afraid of doing something different.

Sure, the maps are nice, but in multiplayer, the computer chosen maps sometimes ruin a few of the settings, such as quarry, its a good map with alot to do there, but they use it so many times it got stale for me.

I suggest buying this game enjoying campaign until 100% completion (same goes for the special ops missions) and then selling it. That is all the game is worth playing for, Campaign and Spec-Ops. …  Expand ", " Before I bought it I was so exited about MW2. Let me say that this game is fine. But!

While having a playable SP (if you ignore the awful story) and awesome Spec-Ops, the multiplayer component of MW2 is utter crap. Anything that could have went wrong with the MP did go wrong, from horrible matchmaking to horrendous balance issues. Matchmaking is a joke, as you will often be paired up with complete morons, whereas the other team is stacked with Clans or users who have no life. The maps are all camper friendly, latency is horrific, often to the point where you will die before you realize you are being shot at. Perks are unbalanced, with some being useless and others (like the Big Three: Stopping Power, Danger Close and Marathon-Lightweight-Commando combo) allowing players to trump any kind of strategy or tactics that one can employ. Most Assault Rifles are way too accurate, allowing for sniper like precision that you can't even get with the actual snipers in the game. Other weapons are too inaccurate to compete with AR's, or are horribly limited in range (i.e. Shotguns). Explosives are used more often than bullets, and are coupled with Danger Close about 75% of the time. Blast Shield is useless against DC users, and Riot Shield users are somehow at a severe disadvantage against knife users in CQC (Two bashes with a shield vs one slash). MLC'er are able to run through gunfire and kill you in one stab. There are no equipment allowances to prevent noob-tube/RPG spamming, and One Man Army allows for users to have infinite tube grenades. Almost everyone spams the Big Three to no end, and Snipers rely on a Stopping Power shot to your kneecap to kill you in one shot, rather than a headshot. Glitches are rampant, and so is cheating.

So to start off, I'll talk about the single-player 'campaign'. The graphics are actually pretty good but are only above average compared to title such as Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (which came out in 2007 I must add), Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Killzone 2 and 3, and the list goes on. Call of Duty 4: Modern A really generic, terrible, and easy game that was fun for the first half hour. So to start off, I'll talk about the single-player 'campaign'. The graphics are actually pretty good but are only above average compared to title such as Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (which came out in 2007 I must add), Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Killzone 2 and 3, and the list goes on. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (which also came out in 2007) is still a much better game, with a story grounded in reality making it believable, immersive and just downright amazing. In Modern Warfare 2 the story follows a fictional team of renegade military combatants who somehow manage to gain access to elite weaponry despite being hunted down by the US military. This game took the amazing, compelling and non-gimmicky storyline from the first Modern Warfare and stuck it's mataphorical fingers up at it. The game's story focuses on crappy set-peices and stupid, overused moments of action that get to be boring after the first five times you do them. The story is horribly clichÃ©d and patchily put together making this game a chore to play after the initial exitement has packed it's bags and left. As for length, the game will last at the very most, about 7 hours which is nothing compared to the much better Mass Effect 3, and that's on the highest difficulty, whilst finding all the intel, getting every single single-player trophy and taking you're time to doddle about in the pathetic mission design. It took me three hours to complete the game on regular difficulty the second time I played through it. To be honest, this game is like that high budget, badly acted, heavily clichÃ©d action packed movie that you thought you wanted to see but were left disappointed and had that feeling of 'wow, what a waste of my hard earned money' at the end. This taking into consideration that this game was priced at Â£55 instead of the standard Â£40 that PS3 games are today. And for those of you who bought the Â£120 Prestige Edition of the game expecting an even better, more thrilling story than CoD4 like me, I know how you feel. Sick to the stomach. However the story isn't all that bad. There are extremely good levels to play (the snow airbase stealth mission for example), but they are plagued by disasterous AI and bad particle effects (is there even any?) in the enviroment. If you want a truly story driven masterpeice worthy of a bit of stealth and epic shoot-outs, and you want a game which will last about 20 hours which is a smart and tactical shooter buy Metal Gear Solid 4 brand new for abou Â£15 from play.com, it's one of the best games out there and trumps MW2 in almost every single way in terms of single-player. None of this is helped by the fact that 40+ members of the great Infinity Ward walked out during developement due to low payment and barely any freedom of developement  due to the publishing company, infamous Activision, basically giving them an outline of exactly what the game should be like, with infinity ward just colouring between the lines. Vince Zampella and Jason West, original creators of the Call of Duty series and head developers at the former true Infinity Ward, publicly displayed thier anger at Activision after being fired by them as they tried to escape Activision's stranglehold on thier devolopement of thier game.   On to the multiplayer element of this absurd game then. At first the multiplayer was extremely sattisfying and fun but a few weeks in and the main fanbase of brainless 8-16 year old monkeys and idiots flooded in spewing abuse over the mic. in every game you play. suddenly people start glitching the poorly designed maps and exploited them to get cheap wins and kills. Alot of these have now been patched but alot equally still exist, and the ones that have been patched are stupid negative pushing barriers or invisible walls. Just plain lazy. People start using all the unbalanced weapons like the now infamous UMP45 and 'noobtubing' incesantly everywhere. Another thing that cropped up in the CoD multiplayer is a thing called 'quickscoping'. Some fanboys of the series (who will completely disagree with this review, making MW2 out to be the best game that has ever existed) will say that quickscoping is amazing, but it really isn't. you go in a game and you're guaranteed that over 75% of people in the game will be playing with a sniper using it in the completely wrong way. This is an issue. As a long running Call of Duty player and fan of the series , I am deeply sorrowed to see the game take the same route as the Guitar Hero series did. It's sad to see what used to be my favourite multiplayer game get gradually worse and worse because of a lack of innovation as the multiplayer is just re-skinned year after year. Call of Duty must evolve or die, especially with upcoming Modern Warfare 3 looking almost identical to MW2. It's for these reasons I will be moving on to the smart gamer's FPS with Battlefield 3. …  Expand ", " This is the best FPS game I have ever played.

The weapons in this game at first seem to powerful but once you gain a little skill you will be the one ranking up the kills and suddenly being addicted to this game. The killstreaks are great because it is a challenge to get the powerful rewards and very easy to get the basic rewards like radars. The catch is that you are only allowed to select 3 killstreaks, so if you pick the three best rewards then it will be very hard to get up there, but if you chose the worst 3 awards then after you have gained all you will feel somewhat unrewarded. To those people bagging this game saying it us \"unrealistic\" are both ignorant and stupid. Firstly this game is mostly realistic except for a few perks as other people said like coomando which means from no matter how high you jump you can't die but the truth is do we buy games and think their good because they are realistic. NO. we buy games because they are fun. If you want a realistic game why don't you just live your own life. That's a game that is realistic. Well it's sort of a game. Anyway why buy a game for how realistic it is when you can buy a game that keeps things real but most importantly is fun. I rest my case.........I've always wanted to say that.

Modern Warfare 2 is (Obviously) the sequel to Modern Warfare, A game I've never played, come to think of it, I've never played any Call of Duty, so I hoped, at least, this game would be friendly to new people to the series, unfortunately it isn't after the first 5 minutes of the Campaign. Gameplay This is the only place this game shines, it's game play is nice and simple, very easy to slip into it and I fount it really easy to grasp the controls, it was also very responsive and really, the best part of the game. The game has good controls, which pretty much every game needs to have to be a good one, having an amazingly complex controls won't get you very far. Unfortuantly, the rest of the gameplay falls short. In multi-player, some weapons are useless, some are extremely overpowered, for example, the most well known flaw, Model 1887 Shotguns. These guns can outpower every weapon on the game from short to midrange, if this wasn't bad enough they can also be dual wielded (Akimbo), the fact that they outpower Assault Rifles and Machine Guns at Midrange is absouloutly stupid, there was a patch for this, but it didn't really do anything, I'd still be shot by Akimbo 1887's and be dead at midrange, after putting 3 or 4 Assault Rifle bullets in my opponent. More about the multi-player flaws later on. Story Unfortunately.. the story is pretty boring and unimaginative and according to some of my friends, very similar to Modern Warfare 1. Like I said earlier, I'm new to Call of Duty, which means the campaign should be difficult on the Normal difficulty, or at least challenging unfortunately, it isn't, I started on Hardened, recommended after The Pitt, and shortly found myself knocking that up to veteran, where it finally got mildly challenging. Even so, the game took me a short 10 hours on veteran, and my brother has beaten it in 6 hours on the Regular difficulty... for a game with so much hype and expectations, and my £45 it really isn't good enough, I had started to wish I rented the game instead. Re playable? Not really, unless you did the game on the Super Easy Regular difficulty and want the veteran trophies, then you might send out another 10 hours getting them. Oh... and people wanting the Co-Op story mode from World at War... It's gone so... yeah. This is without even mentioning the huge quantity of plot holes in the story, No spoilers, So I can't say anything, but just google it, and you'll find a list of them. Special Ops My favorite part of the game and it even has it's flaws.. Dear oh Dear. Specials Op's are basically short 1 or 2 player missions, and by 2 player, the person HAS to be on your friend-list and can't be a random person from the internet for some weird reason, which means people with no friends that have a copy of Modern Warfare 2, will never be able to get the Platinum trophy or the 69 Stars trophy or the Honor Roll trophy, this is because some of the missions have to be 2 players which makes me question again why we can't be teamed up with a random person from the internet or even an AI.. Anyway has a whole, special ops is good fun, even more with a friend, but still is good fun without 1, and seems to be a replacement for Nazi Zombies (Which I've played 1 game of round a friends house, it was awesome) from World at War, unfortunately there aren't any zombies on this one and instead there's a load of missions asking you do different things, sneak through a forest, collect some Intel and escape the gulag, kill a bunch of Juggernaughts on an oilrig, and mostly slightly edited stuff from the story but now is timed. This does however make up for the simpleness of the Story mode slightly, because, the Echo missions are rather difficult, though both have there own tricks to getting them done, such as High Explosive, which I did with my brother, it took us all day, then we find out there's a way to do the mission easily on co-op, using a cheap trick to block the Juggernaughts. Multi player This mode is really fun... if you are a veteran to Call of Duty online, us newbies will find ourselves thrown into a game with a bunch of players a lot more experiences than ourselves and shortly finding us basically being absolutely battered this is because the game doesn't seem to make games around people of your own 'level' or Kill/Death ration but more of random people, no matter how good they are and you find yourself, like I said, being battered by the other players which have a lot more experience. if you're a veteran however, you should find this mode fun, and (Apparently) the same as always with a few new modes, I really like the customizable weapons though that's one of my favorite parts. The largest problem I have with being against much higher levels is that they have much better guns, perks, and attachments, I'm used to games normally giving the new people a slight advantage which this game doesn't, let's face it, someone with Pro Perks and the all the Attachments for their gun is easily going to destroy a Level 1 with the basics. Like I mentioned earlier, IW haven't done a good job at balancing the guns (Model 1887 versus Everything) and some things just annoy you, Knife, for example, a basic tool, turned God-like on MW2, there's a setup which turns you into a running unstoppable knifing machine on this game (Marathon, Lightweight, Commando Perks) which lets you knife people from about, 2 meters away, and isn't slowed down by bullets and kills you in 1 hit, you would think if you are shooting someone running straight towards you a few bullets from an Assault Rifle would slow them down just a little bit, but it doesn't. On top of this, some maps are extremely poorly made, \"Estate\" for example, 1 side of the map has a house (Another thing I have a problem with, undamageable scenery, a rocket from an AC130 would surely destroy the roof of a house, yet it remains unscarred) on 1 side, giving the team that spawns there a huge advantage if they can defend the house and I'm sure you know, defending is a lot easier than attacking, the more you play multiplayer, the more frustrating it becomes, and the more addicted you become, deep down you know you're not having fun, but you're addicted, so you keep going. As a whole the game honestly feels Rushed and Unfinished which is because I believe they want to release a new game every year, I'd rather have a brilliant game, that's taken 10 years to make and has been perfected, than a broken game that has been rushed to finished. I advise you to rent the game, then if you like it, but it if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it, the more I play this game, the worse and worse it gets, in contrast to some other games,which seem to get better and better the more I play them. The hardest part of this review is giving it an honest rating, with the descriptions I'd give it a 2, \"Severe Problems prevent any Real Fun\" but that's only for Story and Multiplayer, Spec Ops has problems but is still fun. So, I'd go with 4, \"Game is unremarkable and flawed\" completely sums up my feelings for the majority of the game, and it gets an entire 2 points for Spec Op's missions. …  Expand ", " I purchased the game at release and it was on my self the day after Christmas.

After seeing countless cheesers running around with this I decided to try it out my last week of playing. Not only is idea of a person holding two shotguns and firing both of them unrealistic the acc of the guns is mind boogling. You can stand upstairs at estate with akimbo shotguns and if someone stands by the front entrance you can kill them every single time by firing both guns. The distance of that shot combined with how your acc should be applied because you are firing two shotguns would be a miss every time in a real world situation.

If you like a large gun selection that are usable, skip this game. The maps a nice, but there are not enough. The main problem with this game is they've taken increasing power of guns overtime to a level that I find unplayable. It's more like a paint ball game than what most FPS fans are used to. If you expect to have to aim, I wouldn't worry to much. In fact the game aims so much for you it becomes incredibly difficult to get head shots.

To summarize the hard work put into this game is thus, playing through it I have found that between a quarter and fifty percent of 3-d assets After two years of anticipation of the fabled Modern Warfare 2 experience I am thoroughly insulted. This game being the most popular media in the world does not even attempt to live up to a standard that might compare with such an accomplishment. To summarize the hard work put into this game is thus, playing through it I have found that between a quarter and fifty percent of 3-d assets are reused from the first game which are prone to glitch and experience disappearing polygons, most notable in Spec-Ops. Use of bit-maps are found everywhere from environment and environment effects as well as the beautiful menu screen. The same engine from the first game was also reused. So I hate to ask what Infinity Ward was doing for two years because I can't imagine a 2 and a Half Hour to 4 hour campaign, a new weapon set, and killstreak rewards took that much time. Granted, fans got what they were asking for but really that just clouds the fact that Infinity Ward just bent the gaming world over the table. Back to Spec-Ops, trying to bet all missions on Veteran I would judge impossible without hacking your save file to receive all rewards. Oh, how does a publisher not notice that the save file is editable? I know gamers love spending hours attempting to take down Juggernauts for hours on end but only recieving the satisfaction of a bloody bitmap marring your vision. This being due to NPC's knowing at all times where you are and pre-firing at you around corners. Even the A.I. although I hate calling it that is worse than the first game. Stealth is non-existent in most of the game excluding multiplayer with real players. Physics and lag control is obviously top notch when you find people knifing through corners at a maximum distance of about 10 to 12 feet away, as well a near random factor with grenades, potted plant physics, and ooh firing rounds into people only to be killed and find out the the bullets had not yet registered on the other player constituting another near random factor. The above paragraph is rather byast so feel free whether to regard it or not. One other problem I found os that Free-For-All matches can contain 18 players not allowing anyone to spawn safely. The spawn problem becomes extremely relevant here but also everywhere else online because no code is introduced to keep the player safe as he/she spawns. Was Infinity Ward too busy to fix this after all the time they had? I understand multiplayer is their focus but come on. Other Developers can put out top quality games in around one year. Despite the mass of failure s prevalent here, I must commend Infinity Ward for creating the photo realistic style and making a game that feels more realistic and hardcore than most, even if that is an illusion. Infinity Ward has done what they meant to do it seems, get rich, addict players, and do half the work it took to make the first one.

If your that person, its great - everyone dies really easy.. if your not, you HAVE to use your knife. Its not an uncommon occurance to have 30 rounds strike your enemy and him still be alive. A close range shotgun blast (kills in one hit in split screen) can kill in one hit, or 3 at the same range. Hit registry is god awfull online. The players that useually get 1st place use explosives, like 203s and thumpers with an increase damage/ sacavanger perk so they never run out of ammo. Then use kill streaks, which is basicly free kills by calling in helicopters and bombers.. untill they get the Nuke and end the match. COD one was a tactical shooter (not really, but this one makes it took like it) this one is more of a battle-feild heroes spoof, where you grab guns with a lot of bullets and run around each other spraying down the walls. When you go into hardcore mode, one hit kills, but you might have to shoot someone 10 times to get the hit to register (unless you are the host). Lag kills this game, and the fact that you can't browse through a sever list and pick what map you want to play is stupid. Half the time you'll get a bad map, vote to skip it, then you'll get another bad map and everyone will leave. The selling point of this game was supposed to be the online, and it needs a lot of help. Matchmaking is stupid, let us pick our maps, give us dedicated servers, and give us a latency numerical value. …  Expand ", " ill admit that i liked the levels where i could kill the people we are actually at war with, then when it shifted to the russia and an american as bad guys, i hated it. do we really want to start a real war with russia!!!!!!  the single player wasnt even close to as amazing as uncharted 2! well, the part where D C was under attack was also cool, but it was ruined by the fact that the ill admit that i liked the levels where i could kill the people we are actually at war with, then when it shifted to the russia and an american as bad guys, i hated it. do we really want to start a real war with russia!!!!!!  the single player wasnt even close to as amazing as uncharted 2! well, the part where D C was under attack was also cool, but it was ruined by the fact that the russians were attacking and not the the tuscan raiders we are actually fighting. as for the multiplayer, it was fun but got boring really quickly. plus you dont even make multiplayer trophies like you do in uncharted 2. im still waiting for a military game to satisfy my warrior spirit, maybe medal of honor will. hell yea!!!!! …  Expand ", " After Modern Warfare awesome release, this game is the best!

Yes, the nuke boosting and noob tubes can sometimes be a nuisance but it's not the end of the world as hardcore gamers claim. It's liveable. I love using the AC130 and love going for the nuke as a challenge. And you know what? The flaws of the game make the game more interesting and provide for rants and a \"booster justice\" game mode.

While SP was fun I didn't really understand what the story was all about because it seemed to jump around a bit with very little tying it all together. So, even though this game was great and equally addictive as COD4 there are definitely some irritations such as the knuckleheads that run around with marathon, lightweight, and commando perks.  Imagine some teenage punk running around twice the speed as humanly possible, unlimited sprint, stabbing you from clear across the room before you can even put a single round into him with a sub machine gun... not very realistic.  If they took away just a couple of these annoying perks the game would be more fun and probably the only reason I can't give this game a 10.

Infinity Ward has given us a very streamlined and much fancier version of CoD 4, but Like many people, when I heard Infinity Ward was planning on making a sequel to Modern Warfare as the next installment in the series I got very excited. Unfortunately, my child-like excitement got the better of me and I spent the last year or so thinking this game would be the best game ever released. Infinity Ward has given us a very streamlined and much fancier version of CoD 4, but nothing new in the singleplayer and an outrageous amount of accomplishments in the multiplayer. While I am aware that many game publications base the majority of their rating on the single player, I cannot understand this for a game with a 5-6 hour story that many users will play 20 times that online. That being said, I find that the singleplayer experience is almost identical to the first game (which I very much enjoyed despite it's brevity) with almost identical plot twists and wild stories. I was disappointed with the lack of originality but still pleased enough to continue the story. The multiplayer is a beast that is tough to capture with just one rating. While it is vastly expanded in terms of goals and objectives from the first installment, this can make it a bit too busy at times. One of the best parts of the first Modern Warfare was the balance that you felt between the weapons. While there were some weaker weapons, on the whole you didn't feel a serious imbalance. This is not the case in Modern Warfare 2. Many of the guns feel inaccurate or too weak without certain perks. The maps feel too cluttered and non-linear to be multiplayer maps (although this does make for a much more interested single-player experience). I personally play on PS3 and have found that once again, the game grinds to a halt online. The first installment had a handful of glitches that made online play frustrating at times but were usually patched quickly. So far, this game has already had massive flaws on the PSNetwork and it seems like Infinity Ward didn't even bother to test the game on our network. All in all, the multiplayer has been pretty fun, but nothing I would invest the kind of time in that I did with the series' previous installment. If you own a PS3 & an Xbox 360, I would strongly urge you to buy the Xbox version, as Infinity Ward seems to have FAR fewer issues with Xbox online. Further, at the game's release there were issues for PS3 trophies and partymaking that Xbox is not having. This game is worth the price of admission, but will fall far short of expectations and the longevity that the previous version had/enjoyed. …  Expand ", " Lives up to the hype.

I have a 5 bar connection about 95% of the time, but then again thats just me. It seems to me that IW just came up with a big list of what to put in in the multiplayer mode instead of actually making it balanced and appealing. The maps are also average at best, cod 4 maps are much better. I don't like how big the maps are on MW2 because I feel like they make the smg's such as the ump45 and mp5k useless. IDK about you but i love to run in and spray with an smg any day of the week. Final points: Pretty good game, worth buying I suppose, online can be frusterating at times but it just needs time getting used to, not very innovative/groundbreaking, not as fun to play as COD 4, graphics are solid and is probably the best feature of the game....One final note: I think that IW lost its momentum with this game, had they released this game one year after COD 4 (over WAW) i think mw2 would have been better, but instead they went back to ww2 and then went back to MW, I think that is the key in understanding why this game is the way it is. …  Expand ", " hahaha i love all the bad reviews for this game.

I really don't know how this game scored so high with how many flaws it's riddled with. First of all let's start with campaign mode... It's a mess. If maybe IW decided to just turn me loose into a level by myself, it would have been fine. And yes, I firmly believe I could take on the entire opposing army myself. Mainly because that's what it usually comes down to anyway... Your NPC mates are useless to the point of absurdity. They'll \"clear\" a room by running in, soaking up bullets like there's no tomorrow, shooting maybe 75% of the enemy units in a non-lethal fashion, then move on. Leaving the enemies with just enough health to ruin you when you try to make it through. Also, in the missions where you have to \"follow\" someone; don't... Just don't. It WILL get you killed. Assuming you still play it after reading this and all the other low reviews, just hang back and take enemies out from behind cover, from a distance. Like a sane person would. The \"follow\" target cannot die -nor run out of ammo- so let them dig themselves out of the messes they run headlong into. There are a couple places you'll be forced to run, but you'll know when that happens. The only exception to this rule is when you're with Pierce. It's almost as though IW specifically programed him to be the only intelligent ally. But that's just my opinion from playing. Poor ally AI normally wouldn't be a killing blow, and after all these years of developers coming off like they're diametrically opposed to the idea of you having a helpful teammate, I'm actually used to compensating for it. But in the final couple missions, particularly when you have to protect a computer while it transfers data at a lower downstream speed than a dial-up connection (Seriously? From 1.2mbps, to 0.04, to 30mbps... Ever hear of USB 2.0? Heck, ever hear of USB? At least then it's consistent...) you rely so heavily on the actions of your NPC squad that it is almost impossible even on normal difficulties. I'm a veteran of FPS games and I died 15 times. 15. Even setting traps and following the warnings I was getting over the com, I was still getting my head popped left and right. Or I would hang back a bit to recover or watch the door I was told to watch while some enemy materialized in front of my target and took it out with a couple shots. All the while my backup sat in some back room staring out the window. Even after I flushed him out with a flashbang once and he killed three enemies, he ran right back into that room to look out the window more... I don't even want to get into anything past that. That point is exactly when I realized the campaign was damaged beyond repair. I finished it anyway, but it was just a chore from then on... I'd also like to throw in that while other call of duty games made me feel like I was part of an actual military unit (even up to the original Modern Warfare), this entire campaign felt like any other mindless shooter. It didn't feel like any strategy was involved at all... Just hide while my team stirred up a hornet nets due to their complete lack of stealth, then clean up the mess after they move on. I could go on about Campaign mode's faults all day, but there real draw to any CoD game is the multiplayer right? Well, it's almost non-existent here. I'm sorry if that offends, but it just isn't any fun. The perks and \"streaks\" are both just so overpowered that they rob online play of any and all fun when playing with random/new people. Like to camp and snipe? Pick coldblooded and become invisible to UAV, air support, sentries, and thermal. Go pro and having a crosshair over you won't show your name nor turn red. Put the icing on the cake with Ninja and move silently too. Just want to run around like a lunatic and wipe the floor with people using only a shotgun? Use marathon and get unlimited sprint. Then pick lightweight to move even faster. Rack up 25 kills without dying and you even get a tactical nuke.... I wish I was making this all up. The worst part is that if you have the PS3 version, you don't have access to XBL's matchmaker ability to set you up with people around your skill level. Meaning that if you aren't playing with friends people are generally either Godlike and will annihilate you, or are so poor at the game you start to feel bad for earning that tactical nuke within ten minutes of match start.

The maps are phenomenal including Terminal and my personal favorite Sub Base. The online play is never stale and always leaves a fresh taste in your mouth.This a much better multiplayer than COD4 in my opinion. Now I will talk about the bad: First of all when you get a big map such as Karachi and Estate you will have what are known as campers who have enough time to just sit in one spot the entire time and sometimes will ruin the fun for other people. Then there are problems with spawning where you can spawn behind a person and get a kill or you can spawn in front of a person and be killed. The biggest problem in the entire game though is the lag which ranges from about 100 different problems but I will only talk about 2 more common problems. The problems can be that you have a person directly in front of you and he doesn't know and he somehow disappears from your line of sight. But the worst problem of all is the close combat where you can have a lag spike where it can either show you firing at a person but they manage to kill you and when the kill camera ( which shows it from the killers point if view) it can show that you didn't even hoot a single bullet or you can try to knife and it doesn't come out.

They hide behind a wall, poke out their head, shoot few times, duck down, toss a grenade, poke their head up, shoot a few times, etc. etc. Some AI are even compelled to bumrush you and shoot you point blank in the face. Something a highly trained Russian soldier wouldn't likely do. The story is amazing, though. You'll see an old face or two and by the end, feel betrayed, exhausted, and somewhat in shock at what all just transpired.

Movement and aiming seems more fluid in CoD:MW2 for some reason, but that may just be me.

Im not saying this because I suck, I got my kd to 1.70 by camping - its the only way to play this game. So while I got good it was no fun at all. On COD4 you could do well bursting in with the MP5, being a Sniper, picking off those snipers with the M16. It was well balanced. MW2 has no balance to it, the assault rifles are the best by far. The streaks are annoying, the maps suck and every one is camping. Like I said this game is for noobs and its totally lost the realism and enjoyment of COD4.

On the PS3 It feels and looks dated (if you've played something like crysis or unreal3 that is). It offers nothing new to the FPS genre and BARELY does what's been seen a hundred times before that well. Its more of a shooting gallery than a depiction modern warfare. None of what makes modern warfare a good subject for a game is in this. Its just another dumb Hollywood blockbuster. It IS overhyped. It deserves almost none of the praise that's been lavished on it. Combat is ugly. There's no grace, no adrenalin rush. No thrill of combat. No inching forward behind cover during street fire fights. Just chaos and dying all the time. Level design is a mess and suffers from not being linear enough. The flitting about all over the world as different characters kills, almost completely, any immersion that might have been present . AI is obviously bad because half the time enemies stand up and invite to be shot. And in the snowbound level 2 it avoids buddy-AI altogether by lamely having you walk into the enemy camp alone while your \"buddy\" takes pot shots from afar. There are far better depictions of modern warfare than the COD series (in any guise). Stealth is poorly implemented with an Aliens-style motion sensor and a lot of snow. Amateurish at best. No squad buddies? No camaraderie? No TEAMWORK. No quiet spots where characters could have been developed. Just bang bang bang, everyone for themselves. CODMW2 is a prime example why designers need to chuck ideas about \"fun\" and \"imitating Hollywood\" into the bin and pick up \"entertaining\" and \"engaging\" as their watchwords. They need stop pandering to juvenile idiots and start making games for adults. An airport massacre with no build-up whatsoever doesn't make the game \"adult\", it just makes it crass.

There MW2 review - \"Infinity Ward raises the bar again with Modern Warfare 2. Its new campaign keeps delivering a cinematic, inmersive, and visually spectacular experience, while polishing AI and respawn issues, and offering a minimum of 8 hours of gameplay\". Really? Do you see the hypocracy in the gaming world from the critics... laughable double standards. MW2 does not take 8hrs, closer to 4-5... and even if it did, thats ok? But Rogue Warrior is too short? Wow... did I miss something? Why does the Call of Duty series get free passes for unoriginality/short/linear/copy and paste work by so many Critics and 13 year olds who have never played any other games to know whats good/bad? My actual review now - Extremely average gameplay, over the top in every way, obviously Michael Bay inspired (so if you complained about Transformers 2, you better hate this game too, otherwise, again... more hypocracy.), plot makes little sense, and all the while you wonder what the point of single player was, same with the 'airport' level. The level serves 0 purpose. I actually laughed. The characters you shoot just fall to the ground, zero body/blood damage. The bodies clip into each other on the floor. Graphics are simply not that good for a 'next gen' title, or something billed to what this was. All they did was turn up the bloom and brightness. Characters and guns looks nice, but the environments are static and do not move, look dull, and add no immersion. Reused textures, sounds, voices, and text from previous cod titles. The background music (which you can't turn off, because options and customization dont exsist with Infinity Ward) is overbearing and completely annoying... I dont need dramatic, life altering music playing non-stop, while im doing nothing or while im walking in a straight line, waiting for the enemies to begin there inevitable respawn (something that they have not fixed, simply improved 'slightly'). A millitary game that leaves realism at the door; probably being used as a recruiting trial. Guns have zero recoil, and your character can take 37 bullets to what i assume the face and be fine, the splatter screen is rediculous, even if you get shot in the foot, its everywhere, and you continuously have it occuring. Killzone 2 did a much better job in that reguard. Punishes teamwork or any real strategy in Multiplayer; it simply feels dated, while being horribly unbalanced and the capital sin of gaming = not fun or rewarding. A game that does not innovate, instead is stuck in 2006. Other games are more realistic and have done many things better. Supposidly took 2 years to make, yet Left 4 Dead 2 was made in less than 1; contains a lot more content than MW2 could ever wish, and beats its own predecessor in almost everyway. The marketing campain, and critic reviews should be all the evidence you need to dismiss them entirely. Truely a disappointing purchase, I have already sold it. The local gamestops around here are getting flooded with copies, mostly 360, but a good amount of ps3's too, so I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this was a waste. Just because something sells alot, doesnt mean its good. Use your own judgement, not a friend who plays nothing else, or rabid cod fans who have never played another game, or the critics who are either paid off; or scared to upset Infinity Ward or break from the status quo. This has to be the most overrated game of all time.

It has this cheesy 1980's \"the world at war on the brink of armageddon\" scenery completed with heroes, villains, backstabbers and people you just can't say what side they're on. You just have to roll with it. And just like those old movies you just have to know how it ends. The lasting appeal of the story won't stay with you forever, but on the other hand you don't mind watching it again. The same goes for MW2. However the campaign is extremely short even for being in the Call of Duty series which are pretty known for short games. Expect between 6-9 hours on the harder difficulties. Then it doesn't matter that the multiplayer and special ops are good additions, those are simply somewhat mods added to give that litte extra to the game (watch and learn how Naught Dog did it with Uncharted 2). The main part of the game is still the campaign. Here I'm sorry to say IW barely makes it. The saviour is the great weapons arsenal and some of the locations. However the graphics at some points are below average and are easily exceeded by segments in MW1. It becomes more and more clear that the MW series is more about making money than a great game. The power of Modern Warfare isn't really here. What could have been one of the greatest games ever turned out to be just a good game. There's really not much new here. Sure there are multiple ways you can customize your character and about a million different tasks for each weapon in multiplayer. Translation read: you can now personalize your own avatar and collect points. So does a Tetris key chain that allows you to switch shells. Instead of developing the game they promised (instead of delivering this \"prolouge\"), IW and Activision focused on pointless gadgets such as the \"Modern Warfare 2\" hand controll or the \"Prestige\" edition which gives you a pair of toy goggles. And doesn't look better when the multiplayer breaks down for PS3 owners the day after realease, assumably because they failed to make the trophy system work from the beginning. It should not be possible on this level. Especially not when Activision it one of the largest advocates for the use of \"AAA\" in titles which in the end means \"we're going to charge you extra for this game\". Although their version is that AAA garantuees it's a big game which has needed a lot of resources but in return players can expect a little extra. Modern Warfare 2 claims to be a AAA title. It is not. It's still pretty good though. …  Expand ", " Don't believe the haters. They just can't accept the fact that Infinity Ward has released another amazing game.

This game could not have been an expansion and those who say so obviously have not played it. There is so much to do in this game that you will probably have to lock yourself in the basement for a year (I exaggerate, but you get the point). The single player ends, then you can go into SpecOps mode and play the missions from the story again, and also some bonus missions (the best from COD4 and some between the story ones that you don't play in the story). SpecOps can be played in single player, split screen or online mode. The higher the difficulty setting, the more stars you are awarded for trophies. The multiplayer is amazing. There are awards for almost anything you do. You can upgrade your perks, weapons and weapon add-ons (ie silencers, thermal scope, acog scope, holographic scope, red dot sight, etc) by using them and completing certain tasks like getting X amount of kills while using it. You also can unlock different badges while you rank up and choose what you want your tag to look like, with a background and icon on the side. This isn't required of course, but it sets you apart from others because you can show off the tags you've unlocked. The kill streaks are now customizable. You can choose up to 3 kill streak perks that you can use. Everything from manning an AC-130, launching a predator missile, calling in ammo crates and support and even launching an endgame tactical nuke. The maps are amazing as well. They really have something for everyone in them. If you like to snipe, most maps are big enough for that. If you like to run and gun, they are set up for you too. I've never seen a game that put so much into it so that we as gamers could enjoy it. Do not let ignorant comments fool you, they just want to be different (even at the cost of demonstrating blatant ignorance and using logical fallacies; their opinions make no sense).

The singleplayer story isn't really a story, just a bunch of action sequences coming at you too fast to even register. One day you're in Brazil or Russia then suddenly you're in suburbia in US fighting against god knows which faction. The blood spatter on the screen is a little overdone and with all the action going around you would be suprised how many times you need to hide behind a wall and slowly pick off enemies individually. Sometimes mid mission, the screen will go black and cut to 10 minutes ahead skipping out on what could have been some pretty cool detailed sequences like seeing a guy get tied to a chair instead of capturing him then skipping 10 minutes ahead to when don't get to see him get tortured. It is also wayyyyy tooo action packed, there is no rest time like a sniper mission similar to in the first game. Infinity Ward didn't do a good job at linking stories and making the player understand what is going on.

I gave it a 7 because i think that is what it truly deserved and had all this over-hype not happened then this game would have probably only got a 7, it should definately not be in the top 5 games of all time on ps3 thats for sure, because it hasn't revolutionised the genre. Everything seen in the game has already been done before in every other FPS so some critics giving the game a 10 means they are giving it a perfect score making the game perfect and better than any other game which is definately not true.

The big thing about the COD series is it was one of the first console multi player first person shooters to be played online, COD and Medal of Honour have been played by PC gamers for years and years, but the console and COD bought it to the masses, there are quite a few people I know who own a PS3 and only have 2 games, COD MW1 & MW2, that is how cult this game has become. Nothing comes close to the experience you get from playing COD online and any other FPS games now really do get labelled as imitiations as COD were one of the first.

It doesn't have the effect that the original had on me but it was never going to instead its the all round improvement that makes you appreciate MW2 all the more. Just like the first game, single player mode is far too short. Thats the only disappointing aspect of the game you can complete it in under 5-6 hours. However the 5-6 hours are awesome. Again you play as 2 characters this time the your aim is to stop ultranationalist Vladimir Makarov who was a follower of MW villain Imran Zakhaev. The story takes you all over the globe from Rio to Afghanistan however it is a bit farfetched and at times you wonder what is going on but it is a game afterall. And the gameplay more than makes up for it. It uses the same engine from the first game, if something ain't broke why fix it? But somehow it seems better if thats possible! Also, the settings really do help with each level some of the graphics/visuals within each environment are gorgeous and only add to the experience. There's a big improvement in that department from the original, because as ive said visually MW2 is fantastic. The clincher for MW2 that makes it in a class of its own is Online/Multiplayer. Despite how short single player mode is Multiplayer more than makes up for it. You will find yourself engrossed online for hours on end, its terribly addictive. The levels give you a decent variety but aren't anywhere near as big as Battlefield. With multiple options on offer you can't go wrong online and you will always find yourself coming back for more! Then there is the new Spec-Ops which only adds to your experience and is an awesome addition to CoD letting you play alone or co-op with a friend you sample all the locations of the campaign but with different objectives and rewards which are divided into five different group mission, you can't go wrong with this and is a geat alternative if you get somehow manage to get bored online. As an all round package MW2 is dynamite. Single player will leave you both enthralled and frustarted by its shortness however is made up with the variety of options made available including the new Spec-Ops as well as the even dependable online, MW2 oncemore raises the bar and delivers another stellar performance and establishes itself as the number one game franchise. …  Expand ", " Similar to the counter part ( Xbox 360 version)  in every way.

The Modern Warfare 2 Campaign is amazing, and full of action-packed missions, and does have some jaw-dropping and shocking moments. This Campaign is the best story line yet, and will be hard to beat in Modern Warfare 3. Modern Warfare 2 now features a Spec Ops mode, which allows you to play individual missions with friends or by yourself. I enjoyed most of these missions and some of them were quite the challenge. Especially when you're playing on Veteran difficulty. It increases the capabilities of the enemies. Spec Ops is a great game mode if you want more action after the Campaign mode. After completing a Spec Ops mission, you earn a different amount of stars, depending on the difficulty you played on. Stars will unlock more playable missions. And then there's Multiplayer. My favorite part of the game. Multiplayer is basically perfect, with plentiful weapons, highly detailed and fun maps, incredible objective and team based game modes, and of course, playing with friends. The customization in Multiplayer could of been better, like Black Ops with customizable emblems and face paint. Multiplayer allows you to reach level 70, so it will keep you busy unlocking weapons, attachments, titles, and emblems.

Multiplayer seems to be more chaotic and level based this time around. Unlike the previous Multiplayer installments, this is going to be one where the community either loves it or hates it. For casual players it may be a bit of a struggle, but for competitive players it will be a blast. The Spec Ops Missions, while not nearly as great as Zombies, are still very fun to play.

Now i can understand why this game draws many in, stunning graphics, good controls, and many weapons are some of the perks that this game has, but there are some glaring flaws that need to be adressed. First lets start with the campaign, any sense or feeling that this is a war game has been completely stripped off, it plays like an action shooter, most of the levels involve running through corridors mowing countless people down, just like older shooters. The story line is not muhc more than Red Dawn directed by Michael Bay in the 21st century, the plot twists are so unbelievably stupid and full of holes. Lets start with the 'no russian' mission. SPOILER ALERT Why would the CIA be stupid enough to send an american soldier who has been with them for 2 days into a terrorist cell, let alone a mission that involves killing thousands of innocent people, which in turn could cause an outrage among other nations? most likely they would have hired a russian mercenary or just cut and run to cover their tracks. Thats not even the biggest plot hole, when your character dies and is left in the airport the russians immediatly turn to war, no negotiations, no questions, just war, because all russians are brutish savages right?? right??? oh yeah, and despite the fact that Makarov, a well known terrorist, was caught on CAMERA doing the act, they could not recognize his face and immedietly see it was a terrorist job? yeah fucking right? the game makes no attempt to explain any of these things, but instead ships you right off to brazil to track down the man who sold the weapons to Makarov. This is the way the plot works, you jump from one place to another with barely any background info, and the dumbest plot twist of all 9spoler alert) the General of the Army Betraying the SAS, HAHAHA! and his big 'plan' was to avenge his fallen soldiers by starting another nuclear war? makes perfect sense. ANd of course the two heroes decide to take him on alone, they dont call the help of the SAS or anything. Plot holes aside, the campaign did have some fun moments, like riding down a hill on a snowmobile taking people out with a Glock, and the Washington DC level, but unfortunatly the campaign seems to serve more to tell the story which is in itself, extremely flawed. Multiplayer is a different story, it can be a blast at times, the game offers a multitude of new weapons and customizations to give the player incentive to play well. However, Perks are now a much larger part of gameplay, some of these perks give the player faster running speed, more melee distance, more health, faster reloading and better aiming, in otherwords, unfair advantages, this goes back to me saying that it has lost the feel of a war game, the multiplayer feels like a high speed arcade shooter, in which those who exploit the perks, get the most kills. The maps are designed in a way that there is no safe place to hide, as someone is always bound to sneak up on you and knife you, you are never safe and always must be on the move with no time to plan out your actions, while it is a fun ride, its a very frustrating one as well. SPec ops is the one shining light in the package, as it is the one mode that focuses on teamwork to complete objectives, Completing these objectives leads to acheivements. While Modern Warfare 2 features some great things and stunning graphics, its glaring flaws make it a step down from the last modern warfare, not a step up.

Let me start by saying that the single-player campaign was wonderful. Amazing set-pieces and grind your teeth action made the 6 hour campaign an exciting experience. Sadly you read correctly, its only six hours. If you followed the story, the ending was pretty cool, and there was no huge cliff hanger that will make you throw your controller across the room in anger. Even though the campaign was short, there is still a lot more this game has to offer. Spec-Ops is the highlight of the package. Whenever my buddies come over and I don't want my multiplayer stats to be effected, Spec-Ops is always the way to go. The co-operative play is smooth and the variety of mission types is refreshing. The challenge is also very fair, and the sense of accomplishment when beating the harder missions on Veteran difficulty is unforgettable. Sure there are those moments when you are in the last section of a level and your partner just has to kill himself, but once you nail a tough level you truly feel like a gamer.    Now finally comes the immensely frustrating multiplayer package. Most of the reviews you read only focus on the multiplayer and how frustrating it can be. While these reviews may be accurate the score they give the game is not. This is because their review is only for the multiplayer section of the game, and they don't take into account the exciting Spec-Ops and single player campaigns. The multiplayer for this game is extremely addicting. It is incredibly easy to hop into a game and have a blast with some friends, but there is seldom a time when your fun is ruined by players taking advantage of some of the games perks or other add-ons. Grenade launchers, commando knifing, and the spawning system are just a few of the inconveniences you may encounter. Many people stop playing the game due to the deaths they face at the hand of players who rely on tactics that do not require very much skill. If you do not take the game very seriously and just want to run around and have to fun run and gun action, it will be easy to enjoy the multiplayer. To those competitive hard-core gamers there will be much rage quitting ahead.    With all parts of the package taken into account, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 delivers. The high production values are obvious, and the single and co-opertive campaigns are a blast. Sadly the multiplayer content is frustrating to say the least, and not enough effort was put in to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience.

This review is obviously more than a year late and I I think that it's a little obvious that the first half of the beginning user critics page is nothing more than a bunch of raging kids who are upset because they cannot win by camping on this game's multiplayer. My only response is that I'm glad that you hate this game, because judging by the way that I guarantee you play, I hate you too. This review is obviously more than a year late and I realized that I just had to write my piece on this phenomenal shooter. Call me a COD nuthugger or whatnot, but when you discard your flaming nerd rage and begin to see clearly, you realize that this really is the top notch pinnacle of military shooters in modern gaming. And yes, it far exceeds Battlefield in almost every aspect. To start, the single player is most definitely and undeniably short, ranging in the neighborhood of about 3 hours or so. But those 3 hours are so remarkably jaw-dropping that it somehow forces you after completion to return to the first level and do it all over again. The voice-acting is tremendously well done, and the graphics, even by today's standards, are simply fantastic. The storyline is extremely believable and the campaign contains some of the most exciting set pieces and action sequences that I have ever witnessed in a shooter. From the very beginning stage, all the way up until the final firefight, I was completely mesmerized at the attention to detail the developers gave this game. The intense gunfights that take place on U.S. soil left me completely wowed, and never once was there a stale moment on the campaign. The Spec Ops co-op mode is a great addition to play through with a friend, providing a host of exciting short missions to blast through. Moving on to what really amazes me is the multiplayer. Every time that I enter another match, it reminds me that this really is the king of all first person shooters. The hit markers are near flawless, aiming is extremely smooth and tight, and the arsenal of weaponry is about as close to completely balanced as you can get. Most of the maps are fantastic, save for a few camper-oriented ones that I veto on sight. The sheer amount of perks, upgrades, weapon attachments, and challenges to unlock is almost overwhelming, and never ceases to be addicting. There is literally always something to keep playing towards to unlock. The newly added unlockable titles from the first game always has me working towards something new, and the emblems as well are a pure blast to unlock. The game keeps track of a huge array of statistics, ranging from obvious headshots of a gun, all the way to the number of times you killed someone with a direct flashbang impact. However, there are still some things that should be tweaked, such as the Danger Close perk and Commando perk, which are both noob-friendly and overpowered. I am a LEGIT level 70 tenth prestige, so I believe I have enough experience to voice my opinion on this. Also, the UMP45 could use a little toning down in terms of damage, accuracy, recoil, or anything else associated with it. The killstreaks are absolutely revolutionary, since you have wannabes such as Medal of Honor and Black Ops that straight up copied the majority of them. The amount of noob campers that are crying about how trashy this game is have absolutely no idea what they're talking about, and are simply there to hate because this game is so popular. And it's popular for good reason too: it's the best military shooter on the market without a doubt. Even though the game infuriates me to no end (at times), I just take a step back and tell myself that despite all of my irrational rage, it's still the best there is, and I know that I'll go back to playing it the next day. And since the game is at a much lower price at the present, you cannot go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy military shooters or shooters in general. …  Expand ", " My friend and I used to play spec ops and took turns playing the multiplayer...All I could say was EPIC.

A not so glorios end to infinity ward …  Expand ", " This review contains spoilers , click expand to view .  As the new Call of Duty is only a few months away; I have decided to do a review on one of the biggest games of 2009. Already the makers of the game have tried to make it into an epic game by having a excellent plot. The story begins at the end of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with the Ultra-nationalists taking over Russia and making the villian of the first Modern Warfare game (Imran Zakhaev) a hero of Russia. The gamer starts of as Private First Class Allen who helps the Rangers kill some insurgents in Afghanistan were he later finds out that he will join an elite special force who are already on a mission behind enemy lines in Kazahkstan,. The problem I have with this is that he is only a private and that they should of given the role to a more suitable role. Also with the Russians already being in Kazahkstan (I'm guessing through invasion) that the other nations of the world (especially USA) would have declared war. Anyway back to the plot, instead of playing \"Soap\", the gamer now plays as \"Roach\" who is taken under the wing of \"Soap\". The gamer then switches back to play as Private Allen who is sent on an undercover mission to follow Makarov and learn what he is up to. Allen has to do this by helping Makarov slaughter the innocent on Russian land. However, Makarov somehow knew that Allen was not a Russian but an American so he shoots him there and then. This then leads to the Russians blaming the Americans for the deaths of hundreds and decides to go to war against the US. Going back to playing as \"Roach\", the special forces find out that Makarov was behind the attack so the team head to Brazil to find out more info on the whereabouts of Makarov. They do this by interrogating Makarov's weapon dealer who tells them that Makarov's worst enemy is being held captive in a Russian Gulag under the name of Prisoner 627. This then leads to the Americans and the special forces assaulting the Gulag to then find out that Prisoner 627 was in actual fact Captain Price. The special forces then go take on a Russian Naval Base and then Captain Price activates a nuclear warhead in a Russian Sub. During this time, the gamer becomes Private Ramirez who takes part in many spectacular battles in the game; such as the Battle for the White House in Washington D.C.

I started with single player and, as expected, it was over-the-top fast-paced action and that's what made it good. The campaign was short, but it was incredibly exciting despite some of the questionable plot choices. Notable missions include the one with the snowmobiles and the final level. Although they were obvious gimmicks they were extremely enjoyable; so all in all the campaign was quite good in my opinion. The Spec Ops mode offered a nice change from the zombies mode of World at War and was good fun, although I was disappointed to see a lack of support for it - but I'll come to the later. Then we come to the multiplayer mode. At first it was very exciting with awesome new guns and attachments and of course the addition of a multitude of killstreak rewards that you can pick and choose rather than being given the standard 3-5-7 seen in Modern Warfare 1 and World at War. Later on the inevitable and infamous \"Cod rage\" took hold and although this was to be expected with a Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare 2 took it above and beyond. It soon became apparent that the game had been made extremely \"noob-friendly\" with very luck-based gameplay, extremely easy-to-use combinations and clearly overpowered weapons, perks, attachments and killstreak rewards. Furthermore, once the insane power of the killstreak rewards was realised, the game revolved around it and this simply caused camping as players would play Domination (for example) purely so it's a longer match and they can therefore get their nuke with their generic 7-11-25 killstreak set-up. I could go on about multiplayer's flaws but I won't. Support for the game seemed to be a big issue for Infinity Ward. Each new map pack charged us ridiculous prices for a few of new maps and one or two old ones. 1,200 points is far too much for a map pack in my opinion, especially since, in spite of this, Spec Ops saw absolutely nothing new. As well as this, multiplayer was not otherwise changed very often at all to balance the game. The only updates on the game game were when particularly glaring flaws (such as the care package glitches or the Model 1887 issues). Overall, for me the multiplayer simply became more of a stress than fun and it was Infinity Ward's lack of listening to gamers that caused them to do nothing about it, but rather milk the cow with each new overpriced map pack. But that's not to say the multiplayer was entirely bad - private matches and playing with friends could often still be fun, but overall I found the experience lack lustre. …  Expand ", " I take issue that the graphics of this game is no better then COD4 yet they ask $60 for this game.

So we have to work hard and play for a very long time to unlock a gun that is noiw one of the most useless. May as well put it in the default class and make the spas-12 be unlocked at 67.

The online is great and i have already shelfed BC2 to go back to this. There are however some elements that really let it down. I don't like the new killstreak system at all. While cool in concept it promotes excessive camping to get killstreaks. UAV Jammer and EMP are good additions but the other stupid ones outshine them and sadly make them largely redundant. Secondly, knifing. Needless to say having people run around faster than Usain Bolt and lunging across rooms faster than a bullet is unreallistic and a bad decision. The knife animation is too fast aswell, you cant kill someone instantly with a wild swing. BC2 got this right. Lastly, map design. Most buildings have way too many enterances. With all the jack the rippers on speed running about having so many ways in makes a slow tactical playstyle very difficult. You can either camp or rush, no smart play here i'm afraid.

The campaign is much more varied this time through with the story taking place all over the world. The major gripe for me with the campaign is the AWFUL AI still hasnt been sorted since COD2. The enemy will only try and kill you, the second you emerge from cover almost every enemy in the area will instantly turn on you and your almost killed instantly on the harder difficulties. The other problem is the enemy always know where you are even if you've done nothing to blow your cover. Hide in a building away from your team and expect grenade spam galore through the window. This is and the length of the campaign are the only faults that come to mind and it is definately very enjoyable. The main attraction for most is the multiplayer. Think of it as MW1 only much more polished. You have so much to unlock such as awards, killstreaks, weapons, perks etc that is does get very addicting. The only negative that comes to mind is the fact there are more lame ways to be killed. Aswell as airstrikes and choppers there as missiles, stealth bombers and even a nuke. This is a good thing yeah, but it does become being killed AGAIN by a stealth bomber. Aswell the competetive multiplayer theres a special ops which you can do alone or with a friend.

Action is more fast pace and more intense then any previous Call of Duty title, or any FPS in general. The Achilles heal of the game is the single player modes, which is what prevents this reviewer from giving the game a 10. While entertaining, some aspects seemed boring and cliche'.

Multiplayer: MW1 was an amazing multiplayer experience. It always amazed me how balanced it felt regardless of the differences in unlocks between a level 1 player and a level 50 player. This was partly due to the M4, one of the most powerful guns in the game, being unlocked from the beginning. With that said, MW2 throws this all out the door. Its not until you reach the high-teens in terms of leveling that you feel truly prepared to fight. The available guns at the start are very disappointing and underpowered. Once you do unlock a somewhat decent weapon, you then need to unlock the challenges for it, then unlock the sights by completing the challenge. Ridiculous. Then comes the custom perks/kill-streaks. For the first dozen+ levels you are stuck with 3 perks. The higher level kill-streaks are incredibly overpowered and leave players who have yet to unlock them in the dust. Game balance is completely thrown off and damaged by this. As far as the new maps go, they look nice, but don't play too well with Team Deathmatch in particular. This is because the map design literally encourages camping. This type of gameplay leads to one team ruling the map, and the other trapped spawning in one location. I feel MW2 is more of an expansion to MW2 than a sequel. The campaign is a little short by today's standards, and the multiplayer introduces nothing new aside from the toys. It seems to me like the design process for this game was something along the lines of \"Lets see how many cool new weapons and abilities we can add!\" without calculating the consequences of flooding the game with overpowered tools.

My only issue that i had and which i had with the last game was that the single player is just too short. I completed it in just over 7 hours which i felt was way to short especially as i was having so much fun. Thankfully they haven't completely abondened single players as we now have the Spec-Ops missions which are basically short-goal-based campains where the gamer has to complete each missions goals to gain a star and as the gain more stars they can open up further Spec-Op missions. This is a great idea and is really fun - i've spent almost as much time in the Spec-Ops missions as i have in the main mission so far.

Multiplayer has many glitches and balance issues. Most guns have extremely low recoil, allowing you to snipe across the map without a sniper.

I expected this game to get a lot of negative user reviews. It's an amazing game. The problem is that Modern Warfare 2 is cleverly designed to be an addicting experience. It's like amphetamines. People try it, love it, but as they keep playing it they need more and more to satisfy themselves. People played an obscene amount of it. It's amazing that people played it so much before getting tired of it. The problem is that the people are too stupid to realize that they are just tired of it, and start turning hostile towards the game. If it weren't such an addicting experience, people would get tired of it faster and eventually come back to it and get tired of it again in a comfortable cycle. Instead, they have played it madly every free second of their lives for months on end until they absolutely hate it. Yet they still play it. With that said, I would like to say that it's only logical to acknowledge that the game is extremely well crafted. You can't really go wrong when you have two developers constantly improving and building on such an extensive series. The multiplayer is very fun, although gets a little too hectic and dynamic at times. A lot of things are packed together, jets and helicopters and bombers simultaneously at work. I still find this game to be one of the two best multiplayer experiences one can find in an fps game. As for the campaign, it was awesome. It was a little less believable and a little more hollywoodish than the previous games, but in that actually draws more emotion from the player. It's happy ending brings a certain fact to attention: This game is less a work of art and more a carefully crafted machine picking all the most efficient routes to please the gamer. It wouldn't take the chance of having a less happy ending, it answered to many demands from the cod4 players, and overall seems to be a more superficial game than others. …  Expand ", " Un juegazo.

What is this series going to do next?  Do I even care?  Nope. Now on to the bread and butter, I don't actually mind the singeplayer being bad, because after all I buy Call of Duty games to play online games with my friends and dookie on the opposing team.  I was kind of psyched to find out that Juggernaut and martyrdom had been removed, the only two things I really hated with a fiery passion from Modern Warfare 1.  I quickly found out that it had been replaced with something far sinister, Painkiller and deathstreaks inc.  The game literally rewards you for being bad, it goes against every gaming sensibility out there.  There is a very high chance in every match if you start getting a good kill lead on the other team that they will start spawning with 3x-4x their normal health.  Great Idea, lets penalize the other team for being good. The weapon balance is horrific, every class can literally use a SPAS or a machine pistol, so snipers can just bust out a shotgun if they get rushed.  Dual wielding should have NEVER been added to the COD series, and its as broken as hell, the 1887's had to be nerfed because people were getting dropped from 20-30 yards away by dual wield shotguns...Yes...dual wielded shotguns.  Plus some of the assault rifles are just too easy to use like the ACR, I mean you literally can't miss a bullet, opposed to COD4, where you practically had to burst fire the M4 or AK for them to work effectively at range. The perk system is terrible, the rate at which you unlock great perks takes too long and not only that, they encourage a very low cowardly form of play, Marathon/Commando/Lightweight setups, Army of One noob tube setups.  These setups are used by badkids galore and they even the playing field because theres literally no counter for them. The killstreak system is extremely broken.  I realize that the airstrike in COD4 gave you kills towards your chopper, but it ended at that.  That system in this game is absurdly broken, because you can literally rack up 30+ kills in a minute and a half, it's just way too damn easy for one person to get out of control.  Predator missle->double kill->harrier bomb kills+gun kills+your kills->chopper gunner, I used this setup and many others used it as well because it was just effective and easy obtain. The above mentioned killstreaks breaking into my gameplay segment.  EVERYONE and their mother camps on this game for their own killstreaks, don't even try playing a public objective game, people will refuse to leave 5 yards away from where they spawn, it literally breaks down the game into a stalemate of campy badness. In conclusion I think I've been pretty fair with my issues on this game, and the only reason I'm giving it a ONE, is because they came out with barebones mode which doesn't allow killstreaks, only then was I able to see, well at least without the killstreaks muddying up the gameplay, it plays as a very competetive shooter when people are actually trying to win and do the objectives on the map. …  Expand ", " In my opinion, Modern warfare 2 is not even close to being as good as the first modern warfare.

Quick-scoping, no-scoping, random \"noob-tubes\" were very annoying, and didn't keep the multiplayer action enjoyable for me.

", " This review contains spoilers , click expand to view .  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the successor to one of the best first person shooters out Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. But the question does Modern Warfare 2 live up to the Call of Duty franchise? Well you'll find out in this review.  -Single Player: The single player in Modern Warfare 2 is action-packed and a blast to play through and feels like a Michael Bay film. There are a variety of locations and each one of them looks fantastic, going from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro to the war torn streets of the United States. The story this time around happens several years after Call of Duty 4, and is about a Russian ultra nationalist named Vladimir Makarov who has sparked a Russian invasion into the United States, due to a massacre at a Russian airport., you being a undercover agent tried to stop him, but failed. The game itself does a poor job explaining the plot and is really focused on the action rather than the story, you'll also beat it in a heart beat.  -Multiplayer: The mutiplayer is the main highlight of Modern Warfare 2, and I strongly dislike it while it can be very addicting, the problem is there are too many game breaking problems for me to enjoy it, and I can create a laundry list of how many flaws it has but the number one thing that breaks it, is an s*** load of balance issues, from overpowered kill streaks to even game ending kill streaks that just break the action very often, dual wielding shot guns, explosive damage being too affective, places where players can sit all day and rack up kills, firing rates on weapons meaning that anyone can mod their controller to make their Barret 50. cal shoot like and M60, there are just soo many game breaking flaws that need to be fixed. There are also a handful of glitches in the mutilplayer that haven't been even patched years after release, the mutiplayer should've had a beta test period to iron out all of the flaws it has.  -Graphics: The graphics look decent, they definitely don't look as striking as World at War did, Ive seen better looking games than Modern Warfare 2, some places look awesome but there is just no enough to satisfy you due to the fact that in the multiplayer your always in small concealed areas. Besides that some textures look great on the surface while other look muddy, fortunately you see less of the poor textures.  -Sound: Hans Zimmer creates a striking sound track for the single player it's top notch and movie quality, and some of the best music I've heard in a video game. The weapons however just sound flat and sound like modified Call of Duty 4 weapons and the explosions are nothing special either they are ripped straight from Call of Duty 4 and are not changed.  -Extras: Modern Warfare 2 provides a fun spec-ops gamemode that you can play with a friend either split-screen or online, and all the missions have a good variety.  Overall Modern Warfare 2 falls flat on its main highlight, the multiplayer and is a real disappointment. In my opinion it's overrated and it's clear that the multiplayer is a rushed mess that should've been taken into consideration, it's a perfect example that sales don't make a excellent game. New comers may like it but for veterans of Call of Duty 4 and World at War will most likely not like the changes. …  Expand ", " It's an alright game at best, the campaign is ridiculous and short, but has some nice locations.

I am not particularly good at FPS games, but finishing the game on Veteran on my first playthrough in 7 hours is simply unacceptable. The game is ridiculously easy, whereas World At War took me 3 months to earn those achievements and made me feel like I EARNED them. Day two, Spec-Ops. Hmmmmm. It was okay. I guess. Again, me and my friend who played them together online did them all on Veteran in one evening, and neither of us are all that good. The only tough one was the Echo mission in the Favela of Juggernauts, which did take us 8 or 9 attempts. Otherwise, it was a very poor comparison to the Zombie mode on World At War. Day 3 - multiplayer. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Rewarding you for dying? FAIL. Having multiple gunships / choppers in the sky at once which makes venturing outside impossible? FAIL. Customisable kill streak rewards where everyone tries to do the same thing? FAIL. Lack of party chat support in Team Deathmatch so you have to listen to children under the age of 12 abusing each other from the safety of their microphone? EPIC FAIL. Level design which encourages people to stay in one place? FAIL. Guns which have virtually no difference between them? FAIL. When you have a multiplayer model as succesful as Modern Warfare and World At War, is there really a need to try and overhaul it to an almost unrecognisable level? Personally, I think no. I find it baffling that no beta testing was conducted on the multiplayer - as surely so many of the glitches and issues could have been identified and rectified prior to release. Day four - traded in at GAME, got the purchase price in trade-in value and bought Uncharted on PS3. Infinity Ward and Activision have really damaged themselves with this effort, and I actually find it very refreshing to see that on my first visit to this website, there are a great many people who agree with my own view on this game.

I wouldn't want to spoil it if you haven't played through the campaign yet. Yes, there are many scripted sequences that limit control to some extent, but this isn't a sandbox style game. It's a solid fps all the way through. The Spec Ops missions finally allow a cooperative experiance that was lacking in the first Modern Warefare. The missions are based on missions from both the Modern Warefare 2 campaign, and the Call of Duty 4 campaign. There is still no cooperative play in the campaign put Spec Ops more than makes up for that in my opinion. With all that I have said good about the game, you may be wondering why I have rated it with a 8. Sadly, this is because of the multiplayer. Yes, the overall expeirience is outstanding and perfect for fans of Counter-Stike and other tactical shooters, but in many areas, the over confidence and ignorance if Infinity Ward shows greatly. First off, there was no open beta prior to realease on any platform, not even PC (which needed it the most). The affects of this poor decision on Infinity Ward's behalf showed up almost intantly after launch. The PC version has no-dedicated servers and does not support custom content. Glitches are used constantly by annoying cheaters and a patch for these problems is yet to be released. Server connection interuptions occur frequently and lags plauge almost evey server (these are all Infinity Ward servers not dedicated servers by the way). Also, some of the perks and weapon upgrades feel very unbalanced at times. Quick scoping snipers, instant-kill shot FAMAS and M16 classes, noob-tubers dual-weilded shotguns (one shot equals one kill when both guns are fired at once), and possibly the most annoying, the \"witch\" class. This custom made class consists off the following perks: marathon, lightweight, and commando. Put this unstopable conbination together with a handgun equiped with the tactical knife attatchment and you've got yourself an obnoxious class that runs around getting knife streaks and annoying the living crap out everyone in the game, even his own teamates in some casses. These conbinations are not just annoying, they also take away from the realistic approach that the series has been aiming at for years now. It's a shame that a feature that was originally created for creativity and innovation has become overly abused the way it has been in this game. This being said, the multiplayer component lives up to what most fans have been waiting for, but Infinity Ward still has some issues that hopefully will be worked out the next time around. I recommend X-Box 360 and PS3 owners to buy this game if they are fans of the series or genre.

When the other team is winning, chances are they'll have ac130's and such along with harriers and chopper gunners making the match unplayable and unfair for the losing team. Also, balance has been removed completely. I end up on incredibly unbalanced teams and usually can't walk 2 steps after spawning without being insta-killed by an extremely overpowered weapon. I'm not going to talk about akimbo models and commando etc. because I would need an entire blog spot about that. IW was obviously more focused on creating content than fine tuning it.

The spawning is incredibly frustrating as well. If I had a dollar for everytime I spawned right underneath a predator missile before it hit the ground or on the opposite side of the map from my own team, I would have my money back for this horrid game. The maps are tiny and either have no cover at all to move with, or houses with windows and doors everywhere for some camper to place a claymore to score yet another bs kill.

And not just get to the main screen and say \"this looks the slightest bit stupid, imma rant about it on metacritic like a bitch.\" This game is amazing, keeping everything that made Call of Duty 4 such an amazing game, while adding many more great things. The singleplayer itself deserves a standing ovation, with nonstop action and an actual plot, unlike Halo (kill aliens, teabag, ride a Warthog, watch a cutscene, repeat). Yes, I know that the singleplayer gets a bit tedious after the first few missions like Halo too, but if you look beyond that, you can see that Infinity Ward painstakingly crafted the story, with amazing details and gives the player a very gritty realistic view of war. And that's just the top of the iceberg: then there's multiplayer. The juggernaut from Call of Duty 4 has been enhanced even further, if possible at all, to an almost perfect piece of art. The guns are evenly balanced (though some guns are pretty cheap), the atmosphere is (nearly) always cooperative and friendly, and Infinity Ward proves that they listen to the people by making grenades act more realistically (erratic bouncing, etc.). Add an ungodly amount of unlockable guns, upgraded perks, new kill/death streaks, and lots more, it's almost guaranteed that you'll never go back to another FPS ever again (yes, Halo counts). And then there's Spec Ops. In my opinion, this is probably the best addition of the game: the ability to play co-op online or offline with friends to complete daunting challenges. At first, missions like fending off a hill with only guns and each others' backs for 5 minutes seems pretty impossible, but you learn to adapt to the situation (and aim your Predator missiles later on) and ultimately prevail. And it's that feeling of accomplishment and dominance that fuels gamers. And that's just one mission: There are 5 tiers of Spec Ops, the next significantly harder than the previous. Add this with the epic singleplayer, and jaw-dropping multiplayer, and you've got basically 3 separate games in one package. Overall, I believe that Modern Warfare 2 is an unbelievably polished game. The amount of detail that is put into every particle and aspect of the game is clearly shown as you progress of singleplayer, frag in multiplayer, or team up in Spec Ops.

Overall the campaign shows the player an excellent thrill ride, but the abstract storyline and short play time hinder the final quality of play. The multiplayer aspect of the game comes in two flavors, Spec Ops and of course, online. Spec Ops is a relatively different concept which gives up to two cooperative players a chance to take on some short missions. These missions are varied and can be quite enthralling, and are definitely best approached with the help of a friend. Whether or not these short missions are an acceptable branch away from a co op campaign is up to the player; I would have preferred to play the whole game with a friend. And of course, the online aspect of this game brings solid multiplayer action back to the console. Gameplay style is inevitably more of the same, with some added features that pump up the ante during matches. The maps are diverse in style and offer a plethora of hiding spots, windows to pop out of, roofs to perch on, and so on. Spots that are covered from all angles are difficult to come across, which makes for many different encounters. The multiplayer aspect is what has really driven the Call of Duty brand home with many fans of late, and again it delivers. Infinity Ward continues to innovate by incorporating new game types into their series (even adding a 3rd person element to some online matches reminiscent of SOCOM), and I am sure that fans will be spending many hours (days, really) in effort of hearing that level up guitar riff until they hit prestige level 10. …  Expand ", " This game is really fun with the perks on multi player put it is a quick game.

No one should have bought this game just for the single player. Multiplayer was the big thing in Cod4, and it's no different in MW2. No one ever claimed this game was going to be groundbreaking; it was supposed to be an IMPROVED sequel to the original, and improved it was. And i was looking at some of the undeserved negative reviews below, and one guy criticized the first person camera?!? and then said he liked halo? its the same freakin type of camera dude! …  Expand ", " This game was hyped like no other I have ever seen.

I had done my best to avoid the hype, and it seems to have paid off. Before I start my review, however, I would like to make the point that this review board is for the Xbox 360 version of the game, not the PC. If you have a review for the PC version, and want to have a moan about the lack of dedicated servers, do it on the PC board. Now, back to I was quite surprised by Modern Warfare 2. I had done my best to avoid the hype, and it seems to have paid off. Before I start my review, however, I would like to make the point that this review board is for the Xbox 360 version of the game, not the PC. If you have a review for the PC version, and want to have a moan about the lack of dedicated servers, do it on the PC board. Now, back to the review. I picked this game up for a neat £32, avoiding the £44 price tag of GAME and other major game retailers. I can only wonder why IW thought they would be able to get the RRP to £55, but they must have been having an off day. Had the campaign been significantly longer, I would have agreed with the £55 tag, but for that much money I would expect at least another 4 hours of campaign. As I am talking about the campaign, I'll get on with that first. The story follows on directly from Modern Warfare, with an easy-to-follow plot. After the submarine base mission, I was very impressed with the way the game played. Before this, the game was still great, but those last few missions really grabbed me. Despite the short campaign, it was worthy of being attempted on Veteran. It was sadly far easier than previous CoD games I have played, and even CoD 4 was harder. The music was great, the gameplay was explosive, and the visuals were above average. Next up, Spec Ops. This game mode is a good addition to the game, but sadly it does not make up for the short campaign. This does not mean to say that it is bad. By no means is that true. With 23 Spec Ops missions, and a lot of baddies to shoot, the action never stops. Going for Veteran completion is a nice challenge, especially on the last few missions. I am yet to complete all of them, but I do have 57 stars, so I'm close enough. Juggernaughts are a nice tactical addition to the game, with a demand for you to rethink your assault strategies. I can only wonder what the last three missions are like. Overall, Spec Ops is great. I'm very pleased with it. Finally, we get onto multiplayer. Well, what can I say? Multiplayer has its ups and downs for all players. One day you will be decimating teams with huge K/D ratios, and the next you find yourself being dominated by better-skilled foes. The occasional bursts of lag from poor hosts are hard to notice, even with my terrible connection. I run on a 2 Mb/s connection, and always have a Strict NAT. Most games therefore will not allow me to join other players. This is sadly also the case with Modern Warfare 2. I can rarely connect to a match, and sometimes I am unlucky enough to be in the lobby, only to be \"lagged out\". That's my fault for having such a shoddy connection though. When in a match, the action never stops. Plenty of explosions, awesome kills, and game-ending kill streak rewards. \"AC-130 spotted!\" I am only level 24 without prestige, but I am finding it a great game. Some moan about the higher levelled guns being overpowered, but honestly, all guns are the same. Apart from those blasted AK-47s. I can't wait until I hit level 70, if I ever do. So, this game ticks most of the boxes. A great multiplayer, a fantastic, albeit short, campaign, and a fun extra game mode to complete on the side. Great stuff. …  Expand ", " This game is absolutely amazing. If you don't like first person shooters then you shouldn't even be rating this game because it's not your cup of tea.

I liked their take on war torn Washington DC, an eerily real concept that makes you wonder if war will ever be fought on our soil. Also the character models are some of the most realistic I've seen to date and the effects are fantastic. The story may be a little short, I didn't notice this because I spaced it out into a period of a few weeks because of the multiplayer, but it is very well told and interesting. The co-op missions are a very fun and addicting feature that allow you to play with another person. Now for the real gameplay experience, online play. I cannot praise this enough, it retains the core style of the first one and adds massive depth and new weapons. I remember my friend and I discussing things they should add to the new one and they pretty much read my mind. You now get extra points for payback, long shot kills, double kills and many other things; there is nothing like popping someone from 150 yards and having 5 different things pop up on the screen awarding you. The challenges are one of my favorite additions, you can now get up to 1000 kills with a weapon and still earn points and also unlock attachments based on which attachments you get kills with. There are also perc based challenges which encourage the use of different ones. I remember in COD4 I had stopping power for all my classes, but now with things like hardline and cold blooded I'm using different ones all the time. The addition of new weapons also adds another element to the game as there are now many, many ways to overcome your foes. You can be a dual wielding psychopath with two bullet hoses in each hand or a sharpshooter with extremely accurate assault and sniper rifles or anywhere in between. This makes the online element more challenging and harder because you now have threats of all different kinds. like when your sitting behind a sandbag fortification and a javelin missile comes in out of nowhere and ruins your day or when you turn the corner and get blasted by someone with akimbo shotguns. You can also unlock many different titles and emblems to differentiate yourself from other online players. There are many many ways to go about playing this game online and it is one of the best online experiences to date. I highly recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of the last one or fans of first person shooters in general. …  Expand ", " The campaign is horrible, it's short, has no story, and is ridiculously easy even on Veteran.

The biggest complaint I have that RAPES this from a perfect ten is the multiplayer. At its best it can be played for hours straight, but all other times you might as well pop in a different game. It's all good ideas but bad execution. The ballance is not just broken, its mauled, limbed, pissed on, and kicked in front of a train. Not only are some guns a million times better than others, you'll barely ever die by bullets. Instead you will be noob-tubed and knifed untill your eyes fall out. Noob-tubing is when someone launches a grenade at you, and it's either an instant kill or close to one. Combined with perks that boost your power and give you an infanate amount you have no defence against them. It's a disaster. Also, the commando perk increases your distance in meele attacks... a lot. You knife people as a meele attack but with commando your range is so long you might as well replace the knife with a spear. Combined with perks that make people run a million miles an hour forever you've got no defence if they come running at you around a corner. Imagine if you're playing free for all in Halo and someone got to start out with an energy sword every single time. Is that fair? Hint: the answer begins with an 'n'. Now concerning killstreak rewards they mess up anyone's chances of catching up. You get airplains and helecopters to spawn camp the enemy team, homing missles, and a lot of other stuff that would be fun for you but a pain for everyone else. The only way to avoid them is to use the cold blooded perk, but what are the chances that you'll have that on every single moment? If you don't you'll have to wait indoors for like three hours until they go away. It also cripples anyone else's on your team's chances to get one, also because you'll be hogging all the kills! Care package rewards never hit their mark and often land on you even if your standing a mile away, and people team kill you to take them on hardcore team death match. Also, with good killstreaks comes bad frustration. To quote a review I've read for a completely different game \"maybe I'm not japanese enough but if one mistake costs me everything I've worked for than I'm really not going to feel any sense of accomplishment\". Another thing that sucks are akimbo (dual weilded) shotguns. You may argue that they are ballanced out because they either can't hold much or take a while to ready after shooting, but who cares when it only takes ONE HIT FROM EACH TO KILL SOMEONE!! Even the people who use them can testify that one-hit-kills are cheap. Speaking of people who suck, all the people on their headsets are either twelve year olds with extremely high pitched and distracting voices or loser teenagers picking on them because they're younger. The maps are good depending on what game mode you're playing on. For example Karachi is good on domination but it sucks with team death match. Of course, team deathmatch seems to be the ONLY mode on the game; nobody seems to care about capturing objectives over camping over them just to get killed by an RPG spammer. The map playlist is randomized, and that's a problem. I wanted to play on the Highrise map today. I played for three hours streight and not once got to play on it! THREE. HOURS. One nice thing that works is the addition of titles and embelems. In the last game all you got for completing challenges were points. I care about score more than anything, but I dont want to bust my butt to be higher on a leader board where you have to go down thirty spaces to see someone who got a high score without hacking. These callsigns are basically bragging rights, and I dig that. I could say more, but I'm done with this game for a while. When it works, it's a great success, but that's rare. All other times you'll only be in a bad mood and feel like you were robbed of your time.

I personally thought the cinematic presentation and set pieces were astounding, and the conclusion was possibly the best in recent gaming history, presentation-wise. Graphics were brilliant, the best I've seen on the 360 yet, with only the likes of Uncharted 2 possibly beating it, and controls couldn't have been any more perfect. Multiplayer is still more addictive than any other next-gen game currently in retail, and Spec Ops is a nice addition, and a lot more fun on Veteran with a friend.

The lack of dedicated servers for PC is the biggest kick to the balls for most PC gamers, and the lack of modding, tweaking, and pretty much anything that isn't specifically in the console version didn't help.

The lack of dedicated servers for PC is the biggest kick to the balls for most PC gamers, and the lack of modding, tweaking, and pretty much anything that isn't specifically in the console version didn't help. I am still completely dumbfounded by this decision, and while it seems pretty obvious to me that they probably took it out to encourage more people to buy the console version, I must point out that not only will resorting to such tactics push many more people away than it draws in, there are a lot of us out here that will never start playing FPS games on a console because of the terrible control scheme compared to the mouse+keyboard setup. The forced FOV of 65 degrees adds insult to injury and makes me want to vomit, not just because I have to play with blinders on, but because apparently this was quite purposeful and will not be fixed; whether this is to appease the developers' morbid sense of justice or just because they were too lazy to make a decent port to PC I don't know. So until they give a good reason for all this, I'll just chalk it up to a downright Machiavellian sales strategy. The other problem that I have with the game is the whole \"game\" part; the single player campaign lasts a grand total of 4-5 hours, the AI somehow seems to have gotten worse, the story feels like it was ripped from Cold-War propaganda, not to mention that the game feels like an army recruitment circle-jerk. I will say that the graphics are quite decent, and while they aren't anything spectacular, they are a bit of an improvement over MW1. Another problem I had with the game is that there's no way to turn off in-game music short of forcing it off by renaming the folder it's stored in. I have no clue why they couldn't have added a \"music\" slider to the options, but maybe that would have pissed off Hans Zimmer. To be fair, I like the music, but I would rather hear the people shooting at me and therefore I generally turn it off in FPS games. Now, if they had implemented the music in a less obtrusive way, a la HL2 or something where it would be used to hone the import of a certain situation, I would have liked it a bit more, but they just plastered it all over the campaign in what I suppose was an effort to make the game feel even more 'epic.' Of course, there's still much more to be said, like the awful idea of dual wielding and magically bullet-proof riot shields, and of course the bomb-squad hulks, or the fact that apparently the weapons in the old one were too boring and realistic, so they felt the need to replace most of them with tacticool shooting range guns. I still laugh every time I see a Russian soldier carrying an IMI Tavor TAR-21 made by Israelis, but that laughter quickly is subdued by the realization that they haven't added a single Russian gun; no AN-94, no PKM, no AK-74 or AK-107, no VSS Vintorez. Aparently the Russian guns aren't futuristic enough. Anyways, semantics aside, it's probably a good console shooter, if by some chance you are lacking those, but the PC version has been stomped into the ground by the money-hungry team at IW. …  Expand ", " I rate 10 for overall experience.

There is also a Spec-Ops mode, which you can do alone or in Co-Op with a friend. This is a set of challenges given to you, and you have to try and get all 69 stars in these challenges. This is a very good idea, brilliantly executed, with many missions having specific tasks for each player. For example there is a mission in it when you have to man an AC-130 machine gun on a helicopter, and control the speed of it, while your co-op partner has to hold off waves of enemies on ground until you arrive. Overall, the game is a brilliant package, and well worth the money, even if it has a slightly higher price tag than other games.

This is obviously a problem, and some of the best guns in the game aren't available until you reach the higher levels. The Model 1887 is just plain ridiculous when dual-weld; you have a 10% chance of living through an encounter with a player who has this weapon equipped. There are plenty of other weapons, such as the AK-47, the M14 EBR, the Desert Eagle and the Javelin, which are only available to high ranking players and are ridiculously over-powered. Another issue in multiplayer is that most of the maps are much to big, considering most of the game modes support up to 6 vs 6 matches. Thus, camping, while requiring minimal skill, is the best way to rack up kills in matches, which defeats the purpose of the game being a first-person shooter. Also, the respawn system is completely out of whack, as you commonly spawn near enemies leaving you not much chance to brace yourself for combat. Although you may feel deterred from the multiplayer part of the game, it is a big chunk of the game overall and is generally fun to play. So long as you don't get into laggy servers. Modern Warfare 2 is pretty good, but the major flaw is that the multiplayer is ridiculously unfair for \"noobs\" who have had little experience in the CoD franchise. Killstreak rewards, excluding the Tactical Nuke, are awesome and the Accolades system is well thought out. The campaign is short but fun and Spec Ops has a lot of replay value.

The hype surrounding it did come through in a couple of places, especially in a particular mission which was much spoken of regarding its content. But when it came to multiplayer, it became ridiculous. First off, even with having a ton of people packed in one room playing whatever game mode, modern gaming platforms are capable of much better graphical detail. I watched as someone blew up a Jeep (shame you can't get vehicles, oh well), and instead of having what looked like a good explosion and physics it went like this: Frame 1: Jeep is sitting there, beginnings of explosion happening. Frame 2: Jeep is turning over, explosion getting bigger. Frame 3: Jeep is on its side. Are you kidding? It flops like a Hotwheels car would if someone just flicked it. Also, there is just not enough fine detail in the mix to say this looks GREAT. Good, MAYBE, but not great. The class-based system allows complete customization, letting you tailor your soldier to your playstyle. Good yes, that customization is allowed, but bad too, since people can build powerhouses that take no getting used to, rather than being put in a place where you deal with the cards you're handed and get good at them. The array of weapons and gadgets is wonderful, but also over-the-top. I don't expect to be seeing our military running around with dual sawed-off shotguns, it's just ludicrous. And of course, I'd like to mention the Nuke. Everyone knows the Nuke, and many people by now have garnered the grin of setting it off. However, it is equally ludicrous. Now, you are allowed to build a no-skills-required soldier, and with enough of a kill streak, a normal ground unit is allowed the power of a nuclear warhead?

Special Ops is fiendishly difficult, but in a challenging way, rather than in a \"Mega Man\" way (you don't feel like blowing your brains out after a half-hour of play) and will keep you and a friend coming back for months and months until you've collected all 69 (lol) stars.

After finishing this game, including a sad yet accomplished tenth prestige, I feel that I am in a position to properly review this game - much unlike most others who simply give a review of the multiplayer and ignore al other aspects of the game. One of the comments on the page that claims to discover large plot 'holes', however these are only holes in their intellect as they were unable to grasp the high octane storyline. The only hole - and a slight one at that is (Spoiler Alert) when the prisoner is broken out of the Gulag to use as bait for Makarov as he is the only one who will turn Makarov's head turns out to be Price. This is incorrect as Price did not kill Imran Zakhaev - Soap did in Modern Warfare one. Besides this small plot hole the single player is fun and enjoyable although is slightly short, but this is only if you play it on easy and run through the levels whilst not paying proper attention to the story. The special ops section of the game is a new feature to the series of games and is thoroughly enjoyable with a sense of achievement after completing them. However, I believe that the game comes into its own light during multiplayer. Despite clear faults the game was released early - Activision wanted it pushed through where Infinity Ward wanted more time to complete the game fully - and had plenty of bugs that players were able to exploit to get easy kills. The killsteaks are innovative and although there may well be other games that introduced this first but they are on a different level to other games. The tactical nuke - annoying for those who are simply not good at the game and fun for those who are tactical about their play or who work as a team - is a great feature that I enjoy trying to achieve. The perks online can also be frustrating - commando is a normally hated perk but if the player uses this I dont see a problem as they may find your perks as annoying as they are all beneficial to the individual. The spawning system may well be a pain but how is it you would like it to be changed? Being a programmer I understand the difficulty of creating such a system and no matter what way you create it, there will always be people complaining about it. Overall I would say that this is simply one of the best shooter games ever created and although many people find its flaws, look at the critic reviews, not all of them can be wrong can they? …  Expand ", " It's probably the best Call of Duty game yet, tops the first Modern Warfare in every way.

So a lot of the bugs/glitches should have been gone but not everything is \"Great\" even with the patches. So let us begin with the single-player! If I had to say it's definitely linear but I actually really enjoyed it. Within the first few missions there are cinematic parts which are \"Awesome\", and the AI is al-right. The only downside to it is the linearities on where you can go (you can't really flank any of the enemies). Moving onto Co-op, i found that fantastic. Just playing that with a mate and trying to get all 69 stars (managed to get them all) was extremely challenging but that was the whole point on veteran. A lot of teamwork actually needed to get past certain parts of the co-op missions. Now the multi-player is the main area in this game though. Initially I'd have to say it's pretty much a great on-line experience but not without it's faults. One of the main gripes is actually trying to pick the right host. Many times it picked the worst host and you actually lagged out of the game. Also kill streak continuation is a pretty bad idea, as it often led to kill streak after kill streak after kill streak. Quick-scoping is also an immensely annoying part of the experience too. Sure it's not meant to be realistic but using a sniper as a shotgun or even a assault rifle (M1EBER or the last sniper you get with ACOG) is ridiculous. It's supposed to be used for long range not every single range! Apart from them minor hindrances the multi-player is actually a great experience! (Minus the Nuke!). So overall it gets a solid 8 from me, but there are a few problems which are still in the game for me and will probably never get solved with the inevitable release of Modern Warfare 3 in 2-3 weeks. …  Expand ", " Ah, Modern Warfare 2.

But I'll do my best to review fairly. The MW2 campaign is stunning. It was the first time in my gaming life that I have been open mouthed. I was blown away by the graphics and by the scope of the story, which went further than any previous CoD game before it. Sure, the graphics are no longer top dog now that games such as Uncharted 3 and Battlefield 3 are on the doorstep. But I always say that graphics don't make a game great, the game makes the game great. The story does suffer from cliche (Russians are the bad guys in every shooter these days) and yet does some new things that really impress you. There are moments too good to spoil here that Infinity Ward did excellently. The plot manages to be focused on the characters and the wider story, which many games have crumbled under. In short, the single player for this game is stunning. 10/10, no questions asked. But the multiplayer disappoints. It has become infested with glitches, hackers and mods that have decimated the loyalty of the community and have seen CoD's popularity become sliced in half. Many weapons and abilities in the game are heavily overpowered and overused such as grenade launchers and various killstreaks. Infinity Ward appear to have become the victims of their own success, bringing forth too many new ideas thinking that the community will love them all.

As it only the second of its kind, it's hard to categorize it as the \"same old annual COD\" that the franchise has become today.  This game provided countless hours of enjoyment, and since the series was far from its current popularity, it benefited from a lack of immature children and a-holes, at least during the earlier half of its life. As such, I am also reviewing this game by its audience at the time; it wouldn't matter if a better Call of Duty was released in this generation, as the infuriating, disrespectful and childish audience of today would strongly deteriorate the enjoyment for the old dogs (I mean OLD dogs, as in COD2 & COD3 old). A game is only as good as the experience it delivers, and if this means that a 10/10 games is thrown to the wolves due to the unpleasant experience delivered by whining, excessively aggressive and confrontational players, then that is the rating it will receive.  Frankly, the end of this game's life cycle marked the beginning of the end for COD in the eyes of many players, despite its gaining popularity, which mostly came from the younger generation.  The campaign was a masterpiece, this coming from a gamer who has quite honestly despised every COD installment following WaW. The addition of Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack brought the game up many notches, and the Hollywood-style cinematics was somewhat of a first for video games (one which has, at this point, worn out its welcome).  To wrap things up, this is one Call of Duty that certainly deserves higher than the 6.1 user rating, at least for its time. The 9/10 rating I give it is only contextual to the 2007-2008 time period, and if I were to review it as a new game today (one which follows the crank-out-another-every-year formula) it would snag closer to a 4/10. …  Expand ", " A good single player combined with an OK multiplayer, makes this game an OK sequel to the brilliant Call of Duty 4.

This series wasn't going to hold back just because it hadn't made it as big on one entry. Modern Warfare 2 is 9.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 10).  When did Call of Duty become the ultimate cash cow franchise? Many claim it was with the original Modern Warfare, but the dud that came in the next year, World At War, proved that the series may have just been a one hit wonder. Then came MW2. This series wasn't going to hold back just because it hadn't made it as big on one entry. Modern Warfare 2 is the ideal sequel. It has better graphics, a better story, better set pieces, better gunplay and of course, better multiplayer. While it isn't a massive step forward for the series and is content to  rest on its laurels in some spots, this is simply because it was so far ahead of any competition at the time.  The thing that makes Call of Duty so popular is its accessibility. At almost any time, you can just pick up a controller and start playing. The gunplay is easy to get the hang of, but incredibly difficult to master. No two guns feel the same and no matter if you're hip firing or looking through a sight, it just reacts quickly and plays smoothly. The movement handles in the right way and while there isn't a sticky cover system like in Gears of War, crouching and returning fire is just as satisfying. Melee an enemy and while the impact is unrealistic, the quick stab is perfect if you want to end things quickly. COD may be lacklustre nowadays, but its gameplay is still as smooth and polished as possible.  But while we can talk all we want about the controls and the shooting, what about the actual content? The campaign itself is no longer than that of the original and while it may not have the complexity or originality of the first game, it certainly ratchets up the tension with shocking twists, crazy set pieces and cool new characters. It continues directly on from the original game, except now a new enemy has arisen. Makarov is undoubtedly one of the scariest villains in all of gaming and the lengths he will go to to attain what he wants makes this as much a thriller as it is a shooter. One oof the first few levels in this game firmly makes that point stick in your mind, as you are forced to watch hundreds of innocent civilians get mowed down. The infamous \"No Russian\" level still holds up and is still difficult to get through. While you may have played GTA, that series is based around the point of going out and killing plenty of people in crazy ways. The realistic terrorism themes at the heart of COD make this more controversial than it needs to be. That level aside, the game is truly amazing and the story is blistering and action-packed. While no level may ever reach the heights of \"All Ghillied Up\", a certain few come close here and the set pieces range from an attack on the white house, to a stealth level in the snow to a final showdown on jet skis. This is action at its absolute best and not many series do explosions and shootouts better than Call of Duty.  There is certainly a large amount of replayability to the game, what with the multiple collectibles, the many difficulty levels and the Epilogue level in a Call of Duty museum, but one mode takes replayability to its extremes. Spec Ops consists of a series of mini objectives that have a score and ranking system. Every challenge can be completed in co-op and a select few make teaming up with a buddy essential. There are even a few Spec Ops missions that recall the original game's sniper level and this is even better when played with a buddy. You can easily put as much, if not more time, into this mode as you do in the single player campaign. It's a bonus that most of these are really fun and endlessly enjoyable.  But I can't put it off any longer- it's time to talk about multiplayer. The best part of COD gets even better in MW2, with a range of new modes, unlockables and maps, including some instant classics such as the rather large \"Terminal\". In all, the new features aren't a massive step forward, but the Create A Class system is a large enhancement and the range of perks and scorestreaks is impressive. Sniping is one of the strengths online and learning how to handle a scoped rifle may be key to your success. However, you really do have multiple options when it comes to fighting. You can run and gun, pick off enemies at long range or (if you're a really annoying player) camp. The options open are vast and while you may run into some fairly rage worthy situations, the game is consistently entertaining. The RPG like levelling system is still well handles and the offline levelling means that you can enjoy your split screen even more.  Modern Warfare 2 is fantastic and is easily the second best COD. It could be said that the series fell into a monotonous rut here, but back in 2009 it was incredibly impressive. In all fairness, it still is and deserves a large amount of recognition. …  Expand ", " This game is actually good compared to the cods that are out today.

Now that I am much older and look at games in a I seem to have been caught up in the massive explosion of the Call of Duty series when Modern Warfare 2 was released in 2009 and I was only a teen. I first saw MW2 by a friend on their PS3, and was immediately sold. The fanbase and popularity of Call of Duty from there on exploded into one of the most popular gaming franchises in history. Now that I am much older and look at games in a more articulate way, I can say that MW2 is perhaps the most overrated COD game ever made.  Let's start with the campaign, which is definitely a good campaign despite character motives and development being very little in regards. I enjoyed the snow mobile ride even if it was railroaded, the pulling of the knife out of Mactavish and throwing it into Shepard's eye, and a few other moments, but unfortunately the game tries to hard to hold your hand in terms of freedom and playing. To hear your soldiers constantly asking you over to objectives and give you devices and gadgets, it was like I was just being prepped more for the multiplayer instead of enjoying a great campaign that COD4 achieved and WAW had not-as great but still well done regardless. Makarov's involvement was just so one-off, yet you could skip the mission of being in the Russian airport massacre and then have no idea who he was (since he never shows himself again until MW3). The inclusion of Soap MacTavish and Captain Price was not necessary, so it made me a bit confused on why a new group wasn't included. COD4's Marine Sgt. Jackson and his team dies in a nuclear explosion while the two SAS soldiers sustained wounds from a ultranationalist Russian organization. It was suppose to be a story of their's and nothing more should have been become of it. In short, the campaign had good moments, but was lost alot of its charm and brilliance that made the previous unique.  The spec op missions were a brilliant inclusion to the game, probably the best the game had. Splitscreening with a friend or playing over a mic and chat was really fun and the challenge the missions held were commendable. The Juggernauts were tough foes not found in the campaign and was great to fight overall. I can't help but feel thought something was missing. Maybe it was the fact it was the campaign maps recycled that made the missions not as good, but something else too. Regardless, it was a neat little side activity that proved to be the better arm of the entire game as far as I was concern.  Of course you have to talk about the multiplayer, which (in the context of ONLY looking at COD4 and WAW for comparison) almost took an entire nosedive in quality. Perk imbalance was still in full swing, and with the new pro effects stacked onto them, the idea of war went out the window. It now became an arcade-like firefight that included goofy camos, scorecards and overload of scorestreaks that it made it feel so dam lame. Was it fun? Yes. But was it carrying on the tradition of its predecessors? I would say no in 100% confidence. With the inclusion of quickscoping, influx of kids and younger adults (like myself at the time) and such at the time aside, it just didn't feel like war now. With the community exploding and releasing a whole slew of hatred and acidity on a whole other level, it's no wonder why so many can see this being the first COD to suck so much.  I mean overall I can MW2 is a good game, but grossly overrated for the departures it makes that made its previous so good and interesting. It felt like it was more commercialized and safe rather than trying to innovate itself again and prove to be a strong arm for shooters of its time. …  Expand ", " Oh. My. God.

Eventually, I Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.  A little while back, I reviewed this game's prequel (Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare), which I hated at first, but then loved the next time I played it.  It was an insanely fun action game that must be experienced, in particular for its single player.  Its multiplayer was good too, but I couldn't help but feel like it was missing something.  Eventually, I decided that I wanted to play its sequel, so I downloaded it off of Steam this weekend.  So, does this game improve upon its predecessor enough to make me love it, or is Call of Duty 4 really the last good Call of Duty?  Let's find out.  The gameplay of this game is very similar to its predecessor.  It is a first-person shooter that has both single player and multiplayer modes of play.  There is also a cooperative gameplay mode this time around, but most of the missions in it are the same as those of the single player, just with one extra player.  In Call of Duty 4, I preferred the single player over the multiplayer.  I went back to play missions from the single player in Call of Duty 4 more times than I can count.  This time however, it is the exact opposite.  Here, I prefer the multiplayer over the single player.  The single player in this game is a continuation that picks up five years after the events of the previous game, and it is insanely fun to play through, like just about all of the early Call of Duty campaigns.  However, there are two major problems that hold this game's campaign back.  For one thing, the campaign is once again too short.  I completed it in only five hours.  Another problem with this game's campaign is that its story is terrible.  It is so convoluted and hard to follow, that I am always confused as to what is happening.  That did not stop me from loving the campaign from start to finish, but that was only because it was insanely fun to play through, and not because of the story.  As for the multiplayer, I feel like this is where all of the effort in making this game an amazing game went into.  The multiplayer of this game is actually better than the single player this time around.  Not only is this game's multiplayer better than Call of Duty 4's in every way, it is one of the best multiplayer games I have ever played.  It really is that good.  After playing this game's multiplayer enough, I finally realized what Call of Duty 4 was missing in its multiplayer.  There were not enough different kill streak rewards, perks, weapons, and other features.  To tell you the truth, after playing this game's multiplayer, I honestly felt like Call of Duty 4's multiplayer was just a beta version of this.  This game's multiplayer is much more fleshed out, and it also added Capture the Flag, the one mode that I felt was missing from Call of Duty 4.  Overall, the single player of this game may not be as good as Call of Duty 4's, but the multiplayer more than makes up for this.  This game is worth playing for its multiplayer alone.  As for the graphics, this game also looks fantastic.  They are not the best graphics I have ever seen in a video game, but they do look very good nonetheless.  This game pushes its engine to the limits of its graphical potential.  All of the environments and character models are rich with detail and very pretty to look at.  Overall, this game's graphics are every bit as awesome as its gameplay.  This game also has really good presentation.  On a high-end gaming PC, this game could look fantastic.  However, there are some troubles with the endlessly respawning enemies in single player.  I have never really had a problem with these in the past, however, this time I can't help but feel like there are too many.  I honestly have had a lot of trouble dealing with this many enemies coming at me at once, and I did not have this trouble in any of the previous Call of Duties.  However, this is just a minor complaint compared to how good the single player really is.  Overall, this game has excellent presentation.  Overall, this is a fantastic game, especially for multiplayer.  What most people are wondering is if this game is better than the original Modern Warfare.  I would say yes for the multiplayer, but no for the single player.  The single player of this game is still really enjoyable, but not as enjoyable as the previous game's.  I recommend this game especially to those who love a good first person shooter, action game, or multiplayer game.

The sound design makes the guns un-satisfying to use as they lack any real impact. The story is your usual \"America good. Middle-East terrorist.\". It's getting tiresome running around desert-filled streets shooting anything that isn't white. The story is presented in such a bad way that you have to piece together the whole thing by yourself. It took me more than one playthrough to even understand what was going on. Characters don't act realistically so you will never understand their motivations. It seems they came up with a half a dozen set-pieces and just built the story around them. In the first Modern Warfare it was shocking when your character died in a nuclear explosion so naturally, they thought that they would try to recreate that in this game. You are killed (as part of the story) about 4 times. I really hope that I misunderstood this because it's not surprising when you do it every 10 minutes. And speaking of minutes, there aren't that many in the story. The main campaign might take you 4 or 5 hours. This is unacceptable and absolutely pathetic. Alright, multi-player. It's broken. The weapons are so imbalanced that less than a dozen guns are actually used by players and if you try to use anything else you will be mauled to the ground like a baby by a dozen rabid pit-bulls. Rewarding kills with even more ridiculous ways to kill people is just plain stupid. If you are not extremely skilled  at this game you will be killed repeatedly by the same guy and when you think you can kill him, he comes back in a chopper. And then he drops a nuke on you. The maps are awfully designed and don't encourage anything other than the run and gun technique. They are way too small and cramped and the amount of players on each server is laughable. You also don't have any dedicated servers, you can't kick/ban, you cannot choose maps and so on. The FOV is freaking ridiculous as well and it gives me eye-strain just looking at it for half an hour.

Now many of the game designers just make games for underpowered and overpriced console systems, and younger PC gamers don't have a clue what PC gaming used to be like or what they are missing out on.  Now we all get stuck with overpriced console ports that look like they have the same graphics that games on PC had 3 or 4 years ago, as if the PC version is just an after thought and a way to make some extra cash.  Call of Duty:  Modern Warfare 2 is one of those games.  The first Call of Duty games were well known for their single player mode, and in Call of Duty 2, the MP was quite good for its time.  I bought MW2 when it went on sale (which is not very often for this greedy company- it's still $60 on Steam even AFTER Black Ops came out!).  I refuse to pay $60 for a PC game that is simply an after thought, and originally intended to be played on a limited console.  First off, I wasn't very impressed at all with single player.  It was short, and the story was very boring, as if it was just thrown in there to justify the price.  Multiplayer was fun for a little while, but again I got bored  because it seemed like there was the one or two guys on top that had the higher ranks all the time that would just blow the crap out of everyone else because they had the better weapons, etc.  It didn't look to me like there was much of any match making built into this game, or, if there was, it sure didn't seem to work very well.  As I got better guns and skills moving up in the ranks, things did get better for me and less frustrating, but it still got boring after awhile.   Zombie mode was fun for a little while, but again it gets boring after awhile when you have no real goal except to see how long you can stay alive the next time you play.   There are no dedicated servers in this game, which is just poor, but then this was just a console port and the PC version was an after thought.  A couple of DLCs were released for the PC, which were just maps and priced at $15, which to me is just a ridiculous price for a map pack with no added features.  What really bugs me is that people will actually pay that high of a price for a map pack!  I mean come on, are people THAT stupid!?  No wonder they don't give a crap about making a quality game, because no matter how **** they make it people will line up to buy it!  Now COD: Black Ops is out, and I refuse to once again pay $60 for that game, after being disappointed with this.  Even though Activision must have realized too late what they were missing out on when Steam announced they made a billion dollars selling PC games online, and added dedicated servers to black ops, I think it's too little too late.  Activision, has alienated this PC gamer, but they can probably count on the sheep who like the abuse to keep buying your Call of Duty titles for a little while longer, until finally even they will get tired of it.  And for years to come they'll have console geeks buying up overpriced games that have no clue what PC gaming is really like.

Nothing really interesting, though. The game also has a story to it, but it's so disorganized and poorly written that you probably won't care much for it either. At some parts, it sounds like the developers just asked their 4-year-old children to write a few lines, \"Then they go down a big big hill, oh and there's also a bunch of trees that they're going by and then there's a guy in a snowmobile going \"pew pew\" at you with his guns then he hits a rock and it's like BOOM! then you're going down in the snowmobile too still and you go by a tree then you're on the big slope then you're launched in the air and fly thousands of feet!\" ... The campaign is very ugly and mediocre. It has decent to nice graphics, though, but it can't save the game. Moving on to the multiplayer, the multiplayer of MW2 is probably the most unbalanced multiplayer you will ever play. The premise of each round is that you're going to get killstreaks, but the killstreaks are so hideously over-powered that you will literally become an invincible time bomb just ticking away to see how long you get until someone gets lucky and manages to pop one in you if you don't kill the entire team first. You earn one killstreak to kill a few people, which leads to another killstreak that continuously branches off to more and more killstreaks; you pretty much get a bonus to kill more people for already killing people. It's a hideous idea that should never be done in a game and if it does it should at least be done well and balanced, which Infinity Ward failed at doing with the multiplayer. Neither the campaign nor the multiplayer are any good. The single and only redeeming factor about Modern Warfare 2 is the Spec Ops missions, which after a while will become boring, and even then they aren't too great. They are, for the most part, the only little interesting parts from the campaign pasted into one montage that you can play with your friends.

The Single Player, while short, is one of the best single player experiences of any FPS I have ever played.

The story is entertaining, the characters are interesting, and it's just a generally good experience. This is where the good ends. Multiplayer, the selling point for the CoD games to date is the most horrid experience available. The first, and in my opinion, biggest issue that Modern Warfare suffers from is the lack of dedicated servers. The choice to go with IWNet is something I will absolutely never understand. It destroys the longstanding community that has always existed in CoD games. There is a reason why thousands of people still play CoD4, and it's not because something so idiotic as IWNet was used. The other major issue that is partially a result of the lack of dedicated servers would be the immense amount of hacking that goes on. Using Steam's antivirus software hasn't worked out at all. It's almost impossible to find a game where someone isn't hacking. There really isn't any point in listing the other numerous bugs, exploits, and general issues that exist within Modern Warfare 2, as they have been listed many times over in other reviews, so I won't.

But yes: gameplay is king!\" +++ Looking back at MW1, having a well told story with realistic motivations in its characters, MW2 has a quite more fictional story with Russia invading the USA over night with helicopters -- nice defenses there! The game has some cool moments, but in terms of gameplay -- which is king BTW -- the game kills you off. It is quite ridiculous trying the hardest part of a mission dozens of times as you die from enemy gunfire having to restart from a checkpoint 1.000 bullets past and then getting shot by teammates NOT ONLY ONCE!!! The game might use this to tell some motivations but I wonder where is the (sorry) f***ing difference between you dying there or one meter past!? +++ Another ridiculous thing are quicktime events, where you can feel where a Wii player has his moments. Yet again you are unable to open doors while you have to do all the blowing up and pushing forward stuff. Some missions are more or less a shooting gallery: \"Go there! Pick up that! Shoot this! Now go over there!\" If I want to play something like that, I'd return to Serious Sam.... +++ Level design also very \"interesting\" if take your time and look around: There is not a single ladder or stairs up those roofs or no second door to a room enemies continuous keep coming at you -- no tents either.... +++ For the multiplayer most issues have been mentioned (matchmaking, cheaters, no voting, etc.). What CoD multiplayer always was is a team game. Here players are not only scattered on the map and randomly respawned behind some enemy (and vice versa) -- adding random deaths -- plus having no more ingame communication -- voice chat was the first to turn off as any kiddy used it as ingame radio broadcast for bad music. Killstreak rewards are flooding the tiny maps making it impossible to play without several perks you need to unlock first. Here it is playing, failing and leveling up until you are able to play the game as it was meant to be -- or at least stand a chance. After all I had fun with the game with a group of friends playing the game to play as an entire team.

First off the balance in the game is horrible, One man army noob tubes, danger close, commando, you name it.  Secondly there are no dedicated servers and instead we get this crappy ass host based matchmaking system that was made for consoles and is a HUGE downgrade to cod4.  Plus your FOV (field of view) is locked at a puny 65 degrees for both single player and multiplayer, I highly recommend an FOV changer cause you will feel like you are looking through a pair of goggles.  Plus the game is FULL of hacked lobbies and some of them give you everything in the game and instantly bump you up to level 70 which decreases its replay value drastically.  But there are also some good things about the game.  More weapon variety, pro perks, new unlockables such as titles and emblems which increases the games replay-ability, and amazing maps such as Terminal, Rust, Highrise, Scrapyard, Skidrow and tons of other great maps.

Cons: - Cut content and leftovers. These things are not acceptable for commercial software. Create a content plan before making a game. It's more mature and you'll spend less money and time. For example, if you don't want players to kill ducks (ducks are cute), don't put ducks in your game in any stages of development. - Overpriced. - Additional maps are also overpriced. - Favela map is available for private lobby, but still not in the map rotation.

Just another \"tacticool operators from US and Europe vs evil-doers from developing countries\" nonsense. - Lags, errors and glitches are daily routine. - You can't lean. - Sometimes it takes forever to find a lobby. - Modding is possible, but most mods are hacks and sometimes custom textures. - Respawning enemies in singleplayer. - Health regeneration. - Unrealistic and incorrectly portrayed weapons. - No semi-auto fire mode on selective fire weapons, no usable bipods, laser sights and binoculars in multiplayer. - Shotguns (except KAC Masterkey) have unrealistic range and you can't hit anything beyond 20 meters or 65.6 feet. - Shotguns and \"machine pistols\" are secondary weapons. - No weapons (M1A1 Carbine), maps (Crossfire), and characters (MacMillan) from previous games. - No weapons from singleplayer (Springfield Armory Custom Professional 1911-A1, SVD and Winchester Model 1200). - Just like in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, almost no one bothers to shoot down enemy heli or AC-130, so you have to switch on your anti-aircraft loadout (class) or play with it often if you do care about teamwork. - Broken sound suppressors (Beretta 92SB, Heckler & Koch MG4 and M240B) and sights (Desert Eagle Mark XIX, Tavor TAR-21, FN F2000 and Heckler & Koch MG4). They should have been fixed years ago. - M240B (7.62x51 mm NATO/.308 Winchester) is less powerful than Steyr AUG variant (5.56x45 mm NATO/.223 Remington). - Russian version is absolutely horrible (thanks 1C). - Russian voices (\"Бросаю стан-гранату\", \"Меняю обойму-магазин\", \"Он ещё дергАется\") and texts (\"Охотник утки\", \"Палата безграничности\", \"Толчок, чтобы открыться\") in the original game make me (native Russian speaker) feel ashamed.

Uncharted 2 for example (yes I'm a PC and PS3 gamer so what? It allows me to know about the subject, and I also had a 360 before it died).

I don't know. If you ask me, making a game's story not fun, even under the pretenses of \"War shouldn't BE fun it's grim and dark and bad\", seems like a bad idea The airport scene was a snoozefest. Once you get past the \"oh no I am killing the innocent peopels THIS IS SO CONTROVERSIAL AND MORALLY QUESITONABLE\" part? It's just a boring level. Killing people that don't shoot back and rent-a-cops with riot shields wasn't challenging, and if it weren't for the slaughtering-innocents controversy play, I don't see why it'd even be in there. But the rest of the stages were no better, -maybe- about as good as MW1, but just barely. Ignoring the ridiculous story, gameplay's not even a little improved. The snowbike scene was fun, and that's about it. Multiplayer's a joke. Matchmaking guarantees you're met up with people that'll wreck you in about twenty seconds, so unless you're omghax good, it's impossible to level up.

Multiplayer, however, is what everyone is here for. Spec ops is fun, I'll give it that, but that is the ONLY area where Matchmaking would be appropriate. It only needs to find one other player. Instead they have a system where you must invite another player who is already a friend. To make this friend you either need to have them already, or make some from other multiplayer games of CoD. This, however, is a pain. I have no problem just inviting random people from different games, and about 35% are receptive. It's the fact that I even have to go to these lengths, when the terrible matchmaking system from multiplayer, should be linked to spec ops. Multiplayer needs to move back to Dedicated servers.

Enemy AI and spawning is improved over COD4 but sadly com controlled team-mates are useless, which isn't a problem on lower difficulties, but on veteran it can lead to some incredibly frustrating scenarios with a single enemy standing in the open and your teammates missing with every shot, at which point the enemy turns, lets off a few ridiculously accurate shots to kill you and you scream expletives at the sack of s**t 'super-special forces' guys who are supposedly helping you. All this means that it is borderline impossible to play this game in any sort of intelligent way. Thats not to say that it isn't fun, I enjoyed the single player very much (with the exception of some tedious moments on veteran difficulty). The multiplayer aspects of this game are hit and miss. Essentially everything good about the standard multiplayer are just extensions of those from COD4 (perks, game modes etc). The lack of dedicated servers has caused a rift in the ratings of this game, with some ridiculously low scores and some the reverse just to spite the others. The fact is that IW.net just doesn't work very well, especially when trying to play with friends. Its buggy, laggy and although it is vac secured, that doesnt stop determined cheaters (not that i think cheating is a massively widespread issue, but it is an issue nonetheless). When it all works as it should, the gameplay is excellent, but then again it was on cod4 as well and not much has actually changed. Where this game truly excels however is in the other multiplayer mode...Spec Ops. 2 player co-op scenarios (many taken from the single player campaign) that are well designed and playable over and over until u get them perfect. But again...could have been bettter if they had released the developer tools for the modding community. Imagine being able to download new scenarios every week from those genius modders...almost infinite play time for your expensive initial outlay. That is what it essentially all boils down to, I cant give this game a score of 10, because that would mean it was perfect, which it isn't. I cant give it an 8 or 9, because in many ways it is a big step backward from COD4, and the more you play it you realise just how much of a direct console port it is, i wouldn't be surprised if the controls were listed as xbox buttons!! All the effort has been put into the gloss leaving a shoddy storyline full of holes for the single player, and limited multiplayer.

It was [maybe] innovative when it happened that one time in CoD4, but now it just gets annoying. It removes all attachment to the player character. You just play as another disposable plot element. Multiplayer is another train-wreck in and of itself. The lack of modification and dedicated servers eliminates the point of a PC game. The number of hacks, cheats, exploits, and bugs that have been used across the different platforms is just staggering for a game that's so new. The amount of people cheating make the game unplayable on Xbox live. And multiplayer experience is so lacking in any originality that it hurts. It feels like it was designed by someone [read: a committee] with no concept of how a firearm works (for those who are interested in realism) and no concept of what's fun and fair (for those interested in just having a good time).

Sure the graphics are better and they are making games more like movies but how many war movies have you seen with the same content as mw2? Terrorists killing innocents have been in every modern war movie ever concieved. The only difference is now we're all sick enough to pay to be the terrorist. Hell, just putting that little bit of immoral behavior in made them another 10 billion. It reminds me of a time that a man in my home town was wrapped around a pto shaft on a grain auger and everyone in town drove out to see the aftermath. Raises the question,\"Why the hell would you drive out to see someone mutilated?\" Well, why the hell would you pay to mutilate innocents? I've always justified playing fps' under the idea that if i was drafted and put in a situation where i had to kill that i would only kill something that had intention to kill me. So shooting nazis that shoot back, ok. Shooting good, honest people, no.

Wouldn't be suprised if by the end of 2010 that games will go for $100 a copy. Why not? most people are becoming so addicted to video games that the price could go up and people would just pay more to get there fix.

Right around the \"Wolverines\" part (shameless Red Dawn reference by Infinity Ward) the plot just turned to pure garbage. -2.5 for failing to get the weapons right, yet again... M16 damage should not equal the FN FAL or SCAR-H. It fires the same round as all the rest of the \"assault\" rifles except for the AK. It simply has better range than an M4 by a couple hundred yards. The LMG stats are completely backwards in terms of damage. All the ones that fire 5.56 NATO are doing high damage in game and all the ones firing 7.62 NATO are doing low damage in game. That's stupid. The only one with correct damage is the PKM (7.62x54R). And Infinity Ward obviously has no clue how suppressors (mistakenly called \"silencers\" in this game) work, because if you put one on a shotgun you just ruined an expensive suppressor and probably your face as well. It doesn't work that way. At least they didn't try to put them on the revolvers. The other thing that bothers me is this whole \"Akimbo\" stuff. You can't control a machine pistol one-handed. It generates far too much thrust as a result of the extremely fast cycle-time, even in moderate calibers like 9mm (mini Uzi / MP5/Glock 18) or the 5.7 (P90). Controlling a SMG or a Machine Pistol 1-handed is like trying to handle a fire-hose 1-handed. You're not going to be able to do it. Trying to handle two at once is beyond retarded. In fact, \"Akimbo\" fails even with the regular semi-automatic pistols. It sure looks great in Hollywood, but you won't be able to hit the broad side of a barn doing it. I don't even want to get into 1-handed magazine changes for \"Akimbo.\" This is supposed to be Modern Warfare 2, not Hollywhood Firearms Myths 2. The pistols are all wrong too. The .44 Magnum is going to be every bit as accurate as the HK USP but the .44 Mag should have a slower rate of fire. The developers got that wrong too. SMG's are wonky too. The MP5 and the Mini Uzi both fire 9x19 rounds, so their rate of fire should be very high and their damage should be lower. The UMP45 and the Vector both fire .45 ACP so their rate of fire should be somewhat slower thnan the 9x19, but their damage should be significantly greater. About the only SMG IW got right was the P90. Sniper Rifles are dead-wrong too. The WA2000 and the M21 EBR are both chambered in 7.62 NATO, the exact same cartridge the FN FAL, the SCAR-H, the M240 and the MG4 fire... The damage should be the same and so should the range. The accuracy from either of these is no better or worse than that of the SCAR-H or the FAL either. The range on the \"Intervention\" (Which I assume is a .408 Chey-Tac) should have significantly more damage than the M21 EBR and the WA2000 as well as greater range and barrier penetration potential. Since it is a bolt action it will have significantly better accuracy. And lastly, is the M82A1, which is the semi-auto 50 BMG in this game. The accuracy of this is significantly worse than that of even the M21 and the WA2000. The muzzle blast is so significant that you can see the puff of dust (more like cloud) from a mile away if it's not suppressed. Sure, the damage is astounding, but it's extremely heavy and bulky. It's primarily an anti-vehicular rifle, not a people-killer. Riot shields don't work that way... One rifle round from any of the \"assault\" rifles, \"sniper rifles\" or LMG's in this game will punch right through a Riot Shield. They're made to stop rocks, bottles, and the occasional pistol round. You can't carry enough polycarbonate in front of you to stop a round from any of the 7.62 or above cartridges. Lastly, there is no body armor that can currently be worn that is capable of standing up to even 1 round from a rifle chambered in .50 BMG. The same holds true for any shotgun firing slugs. There's no armor available to civilians or military that can handle that kind of impact. …  Expand ", " Lack of simple PC FPS features like dedicated servers and developer console ruin any capabilities of competitive play. \"Picking the best host\" is total bull and it has even chose my friend with a 1mbps line and an old athlon x2 939 4000+ over my 10 mbps line and far better gpu/cpu/ram... it chooses bad hosts and makes any pub multiplayer agonizing... in conclusion bad pub play + no Lack of simple PC FPS features like dedicated servers and developer console ruin any capabilities of competitive play. \"Picking the best host\" is total bull and it has even chose my friend with a 1mbps line and an old athlon x2 939 4000+ over my 10 mbps line and far better gpu/cpu/ram... it chooses bad hosts and makes any pub multiplayer agonizing... in conclusion bad pub play + no competitive play = bad game. …  Expand ", " This game is incredible.

Lets start with realism. While the original MW wasn't the most realistic multi-player game, weapons of similar types did similar damage and the way the guns handled at least resembled their real life counter parts. In MW2, IW essentially spits in realism's face, weapon damage is hideously flawed and poorly balanced. PLASTIC riot shields can stop sniper bullets, and akimbo is just terrible. Running around like a retard with a Desert Eagle in each hand essentially allows you to dominate everything in your path, lazy Halo 2 style reload animations are also a bit annoyance. Another problem has got to be that terrible overlay that covers your screen when you get shot, it causes terrible tunnel vision and IMO looks plain ugly, the old CoD2/4 style overlay worked fine and didn't guarantee a death the moment you were hit. Also, blood spattering over your eyes is a illogical when getting hit in any body part other than the face. Also, plastic AKs and uber tacticool weapons felt gimmicky and unrealistic. Everything felt over the top and over done. Before in the CoD series you were always a grunt, fighting on the front lines or a member of an actual Special Ops group (SAS). MW2 turns you into the ultimate special ops soldier where instead of fighting in historical or realistic fights, you are I don't know, on top of a Burger Joint in DC fighting Russians, at least the setting in MW1 was realistic, happening in plausible areas for conflict. Multiplayer is just plain terrible. Over done perks and weapon attachments make dying/killing even easier, Camping is worse than ever, hackers roam free thanks to IWNet. Xbox style matchmaking feels lazy and frankly stupid. I liked being able to sort through a generous list of servers to find one with the map/game mode that I want with a decent ping. And then what happens when IW drops support for MW2, will multiplayer just stop working? Being a Counter-Strike Source player, I understand the importance of community created content and maps in the longevity of a title, but it seems as if IW wants us to play this game and throw it out so hopefully we will buy the next piece of shit they turn out next year. Also, Valve's Steam system isn't the reason for the loss of dedicated servers. Steam is a distribution/publishing tool. After all, Valve understands the importance of dedicated servers IE.

Then you can't connect to the host, then the lobby is suddenly closed, then its not possible to merge lobbies.... Once you're in the game it can easily be ruined by a bad host causing much lag. Only one can hope there'll be a patch soon that makes dedicated servers possible again. Conclusion: Shame on you Infinity!

I was not overly impressed, but it's not as bad as it could have been. Now for the multiplayer review. I would have to say, I am not impressed. For now let us set aside all of the debates about dedicated servers, and all of the controversy over the decision to cut it. I began my first match of multiplayer fairly fast. The matchmaking removed the ability to search for the best server, instead it \"automated\" this. Fine, i'd prefer to search for one, but I am willing to give this a shot. I sit an the lobby for about a minute and I am in my first Free-For-All game of COD:MW2. The pace seemed slow, but I attributed that to my lack of playtime. Somehow, I ended up first in score, I win the match. Great, no. Not really. I wasn't excited, but again I blamed this on my lack of play time. Two days later, I write this review. I see all of the negative comments being made, and if you haven't, I recommend going to the Infinity Ward forums and seeing what the people are saying in the pc section. It's amazing how slighted alot of PC Gamers feel. Admittedly IW said there would be dedicated servers. They didn't deliver this, instead you're hosting off of one of the people you're playing with. This causes issues of course, especially lag. Hopefully when your playing, the host doesn't leave. If they do you have in my experience a fifty fifty chance of the game ending. Not so good. I also noticed some issues with host migration, in fact when you see this error. It will direct you towards an Infinity Ward web page, explaining that your router may be the cause. What they aren't saying on there is, that it may have selected a host other than yourself who hasn't left their computer completely open to the wilds of the internet. Now, for all of the anger and hatred being directed at Infinity Ward. I understand some feel mistreated, especially since IW got it's start and popularity from the PC Gaming community. But don't forget, they are a business first and foremost. This means that alot of people got together and made this decision before launch. That being said, removing the ability for the community to create content is, in my humble opinion, a mistake, and one that you will see with future releases. I won't take the time to argue why or why not dedicated servers are important. I will just say that they are a better idea than peer-to-peer, and client hosting. I wait and hope that like left for dead, they patch and allow us to have dedicated servers that we may pick from. I will also say, that since I purchased this game and have played it online, I am very disappointed with the community I have played with. While there are a few people that understand teamwork, they are few and far between. When I play any of the First Person Shooters that I own, which is alot, I have the ability to play one specific servers, and take part in many communities. I have the choice, I am not lumped in with people I don't know, I am allowed my choice of map, settings, ect. This is a blow to the PC Gaming community, in an epic way.

I seriously think that those who experience game-breaking lag should blame their Internet service providers before MW2. Out of dozens of matches I have so far played I have encountered noticable lag only a couple of times, and although I must admit that I have a 100mbps fiber-optic Internet connection at my home my friends playing on a regular DSL fared no worse. The matchmaking system can use a little tweaking for level-balancing and such (which is pretty easy to do and will surely come with future patches) but otherwise is very quick and efficient in finding matches. In CoD 4 (where I played to Prestige 3) I have never ever deviated from servers running anything but the original, official game ruleset so as far as all the fuss about the lack of dedicated server and player-modding support is concerned, I really fail to see the meaning of it. Someone mentioned something about better anti-cheat protection because dedicated hosts can ban people from their servers, but I will take the new system where cheaters will get banned from ALL servers simultaneously over the old one any time, thank you very much.

This seriously hurts the immersion, as after all you are supposed to feel like part of the war machine. The last few levels get even more ridiculous, as you will find yourself killing hundreds of enemies almost alone. The plot is simpl horrible. It does not make any sense. There is a terrorist plot which triggers a war between Russia and the US, but there is no way the plot could work unless the entire world is dumb. Well, perhaps the Russians are overly aggressive and are just waiting for an excuse to trash D.C., but the story does not show this too well. There are some great levels, both in the battle and in the spec ops department. You do find yourself in awe a couple of times, even though the setting and the ideas are not very fresh anymore.

This is probably because I've always had to deal with 100-150 ping, seeing as I have a really crappy internet connection. And i thought I'd be unhappy with small matches, seeing as I always gravitated to the big ones in Mod1, but it's actually extremely fun, mainly because the maps are small enough to fit the number of players, there's less random death from explosives/snipers (though people still do abuse the grenade launcher, which pushes my buttons), and you can actually hold a grudge and get some satisfaction out of backstabbing the guy who just blew your head off, making MP in Mod2 more satisfying, for me, than the legions of random players I had to contend with in Mod1. But again, this just might be me. The lack of dedicated servers is annoying, and VAC is not nearly as good at policing non-Valve games, but hackers actually, in a certain perverse sense, make the game more fun, because, as I said, it's much more satisfying to kill a hacker when there's only eight players total. Further, seeing as I have crappy ping, I don't really like the matchmaking, because I always liked to find the lowest ping game available, and the matchmaking has some weird protocol that excludes me from those matches because I have high ping. Also, the claim that matchmaking will put you with people close to your own rank is mostly for naught, so don't get your hopes up.

There will be those ignorant ones who buy this game, but I will not. Were it given to me for free I would not play it. There is no command console, no mods; two things which are central to PC gaming. When you take those out, you leave nothing special for which a PC gamer should be excited. Also charging another $10 over the normal price of a PC game is rather pompous. We WILL NOT take this insubordination and persecution. Infinity Ward and Activision has done something to the effect of corporate suicide by trying to force us gamers to take this. By changing a venerable series and turning it into a cash cow they have bitch slapped us. The retail release can play today but the steam edition cannot be played for another few days.

The game is riddled with latency problems, regardless of the quality of the host. In four hours of multiplayer, just one match displayed a connection that was comparable to a local dedicated server.

Console gamers are unlikely to notice the difference - but I'm not playing on a console. The single player, however, is of a much higher standard than the multiplayer component; although to call it above average is perhaps too optimistic. Playing on Normal, the campaign was a forgettable 7 hours. It's not a bad story by any stretch of the imagination, but I kept thinking to myself \"when this ends... I'm stuck with the multiplayer.\" As with CoD4, there's no point that you really want to replay just for the sake of \"it's so cool\", unlike the Russian campaign of the original CoD. Console gamers have the edge here; the game is worth replaying for them, to get their achievements/trophies for beating it on Veteran - if you care about that sort of thing. Considering the game is running on a (modified) 3 year old engine, it does very well visually. It's certainly not Crysis, but I wasn't expecting it to be.

Everything else that they complain about is irrelevant and was just drummed up so they could complain about every little thing wrong with it. Time for my unbiased review: Single Player: Despite what most people are saying, the SP is not 4 hours long. It is just about as long as MW1's SP. I went through a strict set of guidelines while playing through both to compare them: 1. No Camping 2. No \"running\" the maps 3. No deaths 4. Mission Briefings had to be played to the end of the video, then I could start the map. #3 in particular has some sub-rules to it. 3.1 If I did die I reset the timer and started the SP from the beginning. 3.2 Time counted up to a death was not included in the final count. I played both of them on Hardened mode and only died 3 times during MW2 SP and none during MW1. My times were: MW1: 6 Hours and 45 Minutes MW2: 6 Hours and 30 Minutes As you can see, the times are very similar if you play the game the way it is meant to be played tactically with out camping or running. The plot was fairly solid and offers many plot twists and tons of action. This game is more action oriented then MW1. There are tons of new weapons and tools that can be fit on to the weapons. Such as a silencer or HBM (Heart Beat Monitor). Multiplayer: This is the crux of MW2 and does have some issues. While I did say there were some issues, there are no where near as bad as a lot of the people claim. Like the massive lags? Mostly thats from their crappy dsl connection. You will need at least 8 Meg Download speeds to play this with no lag. Even then the Hosts upload speed does factor into it as well. That said in my 13 hours of MP I have not had very much lag at all. I would say 78% of all of my games so far have been lag free, 10% of them have had some lag, 8% of them have had moderate lag, and 4% of my games have had horrible lag. Matchmaking is fairly quick and very efficient. You get into your games in at most 30 seconds and at least 8 seconds. Host Migration is also works pretty well. About the same time frame as Matchmaking. There have been sometimes that the game has dropped out after trying to migrate the host, however this was only twice so far in 13 hours of gameplay. The kill streaks are awesome, once you unlock some of them you can call in predator missile strikes, bombing runs and even take control of an AC130. There is a lot of content to unlock like emblems, call signs, weapon parts, various perks, and game modes. IWNet is doing an alright job so far. Take what teh haters say with a grain of salt and give the game a chance and see for your self.

They were good pick-up fun but didn't keep me hooked like they seemed to do for others. I think that is because I played those games on the console systems as opposed to the PC. This new COD MW2 keeps me hooked, and it keeps me hooked for most of the reasons that people hate this game. I'll explain. Big Issue Number One: The biggest gripe, and part of the reason for rating an 8 is that the game doesn't have dedicated servers. However, even if it did, I would still find myself playing the official ones hosted individually most of the time because people who moderate ded. servers are usually strung-out over caffeinated children that ban people for no good reason... like if they are killed too much by you. That gets old extremely fast, but I would definitely want the option to have them. Big Issue Number Two: There's no leaning or cover system, and guess what, I like it this way. This game is still a competition of multiplayer prowess and I find it hard to play, yet challenging, which is good. I can't imagine this game with people hiding behind stuff... never moving... and leaning with belt-fed machine guns. Sorry, I've played a lot of a game called War Rock and I've had enough of that jazz. Big Issue Number Three: 9 versus 9 limitation as opposed to 16v16, I believe, for the console versions. Gaming enthusiasts as well as the modern preteen out there are bringing up the fact that there aren't as many people per match and that this game suffers from a gameplay value because of this. I say, wrong. The console offerings have more players, yes, but they are also more chaotic. There are \"too many\" people in those \"small\" levels. That's how I look at it. Sure, the levels aren't \"small\", but compared to other shooter games, they can seem small. I mention this because every 1 in 5 deaths on the console is because you got spawned directly within 15 feet of an enemy and as soon as you began to run... they'd spot you and down you like the little campers that they are. They were able to do that so easily because of the fact that if you have even one DECENT team full of people, that side will DOMINATE the other team to the point where \"mercy\" doesn't even begin to apply. I think it's a good idea to curb lag on the PC by offering 9v9. I think it's quite fair and helps ensure that you aren't just dying for the sake of dying. You have more chances to walk 10 or more steps and fire a gun a few times than the console counterparts. From here, I'll rate the typical gameplay, sound, graphics, tilt, and overall score. * - Gameplay - * I don't play the single player - most people don't. There's a ton of people, especially through steam, that need to double their medication in this regard because there are people that have only heard that this game is short... and so they say the story is garbage and \"over-played\" and \"no fun\". It's short, yes, so are most shooting games. Longest I've seen in a long time is the newest Wolfenstein, oddly enough, but you don't see people raving how amazing the game is simply because it had a great single player mode, do you? Multiplayer is where it's at, and yes, while you sometimes have lag issues, that's expected on the PC platform. There are so many different types of networking equipment that differ from each and every single person playing that it doesn't matter what server, equipment, hardware or software you are using, the latency that you connect to whatever server/ host will ALWAYS be different for each and every player no matter what, even on PS3/ Xbox360 and yes, they lag there too... apparently people have forgotten this?... or at least choose to. * - Sound - * The sound effects could be better, but they aren't bad at all. The gun sounds are still pretty solid even though they could use a little more work. The biggest issue regarding sound is the amount of simultaneous noises going on at once. I have a sound card that can output 128 noises in CMSS3D technology and it's still kind of hard to find the enemy sometimes. You can take this as a pro or a con, however, since utilizing enough sounds on a battlefield to not be able to instantly find your opponents, even while using a superiors sound card, does tend to make you think that Infinity Ward put forward the effort to dilute many of the \"dead give away\" type moments which can help shield both the noob and the pro while still capturing that \"in-the-moment\" feeling that keeps you pumped up while playing the game. * - Graphics - * Can they be better? Yes. And that's all that should maybe be said, in short. Going into detail, it's easy to understand why they didn't completely super-power this title. It runs on the same game engine as the other COD games, which helps with frame rates, but if you're using a graphics card from about 2 years prior to this game's release date then you may not have the power, graphically speaking, to run the game at great resolutions with \"appropriate eye candy\" anyways. I personally have a top of the line (IMO) gaming computer and I find that the game performs very well. I rarely find outright \"flaws\" in the game mechanics regarding graphics or sloppy textures unless I specifically go looking for them. I was also happily surprised to find that there are many, many more objects that cast shadows or can be blown away by bullets, explosions, or other debris. Throwing a grenade into an office building feels pretty appropriate. About the only thing that doesn't happen is the cubicle walls aren't hurt... but that's more about preserving fairness as well. Graphics are certainly not an issue that you should be concerned with. They are great, albeit revised from CODMW1, and help provide a more seamless gameplay. * - Tilt - * The game offers various different ways to level up your arsenal, which is fantastic for me. The traditional system of the other COD games of leveling up your perks was something that I found particularly interesting... but felt there was something missing. Now, with this game, perks themselves can be leveled up by themselves as well as your weapons and other equipment. This is viewed as tedious and negative by the nay-sayers, but I'll tell you why I think it's a good thing. It's a good thing, in my opinion, because you won't have one person excel at every particular aspect of the game just because their level is higher and they have more guns/ experience. The first game I was dropped into I did a respectable 11-5, not bad for my first time at all. The perks/ weapon setups are only overpowered in \"certain ways\", in the sense that many perks can stomp out others. Marathon, a perk which makes you able to run an unlimited amount and at a faster rate, is a good one to have against people that don't have the \"Stopping Power\" perk, whose weapons deal more damage, because it's harder for them to put enough effective shots down range to defeat you, and vice versa. And this is across the board for all of the perks no matter what level they are. Some are annoying, true... but that's war. * - Overall - * There are lots of things that make me a little bit mad about this game, but none really hurt the overall game to me TOO badly. If it does, I shut down the game, like any other ADULT would do, and find something actually worthwhile with my time than playing video games all day. It's not that bad to have a hacker kill you - it's on the PC - it's going to happen... sadly, but true. To think otherwise would be to lie to yourself. Also, the community, particularly the PC community, is whining for so many reasons and they don't realize how badly their ideas contradict one another. I find it funny that people complain about lag or constantly having to find new hosts for games... yet want more players in the game at once at the same time. Guess what? In the older COD games that these guys will say to play instead of this one, if the host leaves, the game entirely ends. At least the game doesn't just flipping END prematurely. In fact, it hasn't even ENTIRELY DROPPED for me on my cable connection one single time yet, so I don't know what all these people are talking about, although I could understand people outside the USA having ping-related mishaps until better servers are setup for people or better match-making is added in a patch. The biggest things people complain about with the PC CODMW2 is that it doesn't have dedicated servers, only has 9v9 players, doesn't have a \"command\" key (using the ` key to alter game options), and doesn't have additional \"filters\" for the PC version that make \"less debris\" or \"less objects\" on the screen. Well guess what? For all of those losers trying to gain a SLIGHT competitive edge just by deleting the floating stuff in the air or removing miscellaneous bricks on the ground and stuff... or by altering your viewing angle/ position to something someone at default doesn't have... for all of you guys, all I can say is \"grow up and learn to play the game as it was intended to be played\". It's pretty clear that this is more or less a direct port of a game made on the console, yes. But it's not a \"bad game\" at all just because of this. It is seriously hilarious how many people say \"this game is washed out, over played, has nothing greatly new, uses the same old junkie game engine\" etc. and so on... but then say, \"Don't play this game, play the old one\". I find that so hilarious, personally, because those people sit here and bash this game partly for being similar to the previous modern warfare and then they suggest to play that one instead... you know, the one that they can adjust their viewing angles, use dedicated servers with their buddies without anti-cheat protection to pretend that they are good at the game while kicking every good player off of the server... yeah, that game. The bottom line is that if you pick this up and like first person shooters, especially rushing combat and lots of customization options and leveling abilities, then this game is going to keep you entertained for a long time. At the end of the day, I buy games to have fun, and I'm having a lot of fun. I'd say this is money well-spent even despite not having the option for dedicated servers or larger game rooms, but overall, I'm personally glad that there aren't dedicated servers and larger game rooms by default.

More than once i found myself totally engrossed with the characters, or pining to find out what was happening with other characters elsewhere in the world. The set-pieces are tough and always fun to play through, and the tension is palpable. Quite simply, when you get going in this, you will WANT to see it through, to see how it ends. The SO mode of SP gives a certain level of replayablitiy to the game, but it can sometimes feel arcadeish. Even so the games cinematic combat will quickly wash over you and you will find yourself engrossed in your mission. I would mark the game down one or two marks for this mode, but the SP and MP are well deserving of a 10 alone. Multiplayer is epic. Dragging that out would be pointless. The lack of dedicated servers does not make matchmaking worse, only different, and does away with annoying clan servers that insist on advertising themselves every ten seconds. There's a better variety in the perks from COD4. Weapons and attachments are also more numerous, with unlikely weapons such as the AA-12 fully automatic shotgun, and the heavy duty FIM118 Javelin seen in one of COD4's set-pieces, making very welcome apperances as unlockable weapons. This gives much more variety to players, from sinpers to anti-aircraft soldiers commonplace. The kill-streaks are one of the highpoints of MP warfare. Calling in AC-130 gunships, HIND's, Harriers and even the game ending Tactical Nuke is an endlessly fun part of the game. Theres a far greater variety here than COD4, with the ability to choose 3 out of approx. 20 for any one game. MP Lag varies, but is in reality a non-issue, and switching hosts mid game ( An effect of user hosted games ) is handled as well as could be asked. It's unfortunate the rap this game is getting from disgruntled gamers. 90% of the reviews you will find here are for lack of a better term. Butthurt. It's unlikely that many of the 0 raters have played this game significantly. Tragically, they have picked out a very small number of Issues ( Not even bugs ) and gone into a frenzy.

The game isn't balanced for playing on PC, they took out LEAN. PINBALL MACHINES EVEN HAVE LEAN. Infinity Wards choice to take out lean is unnecessary, and just plain lazy. The IWnet system put into place to replace dedicated servers is a joke, the modding community, Clans, meeting people to play with is all dead. you join random games with random people all day, you don't know whether the game is going to lag or not, and that's if you can get in. Half the people playing don't have their routers set up properly to accept incoming connections, so when the game is set up, if IWnet picks a host without their router being set up properly, the entire lobby closes and you have to wait another full minute to HOPEFULLY find a host who can, I've waited 18 minutes to join a match due to bad luck with hosts. The PC version of this game might as well say \"Xbox with keyboard and mouse support\" as it is a direct port of the console version.

While MW2 still retains the fast paced action of it's predecessor, the higher latencies caused by Peer-2-Peer connections is quite game-breaking for the fast paced action. With dedicated servers on Call of Duty 4 I would average 40-55 milliseconds of delay, but on MW2 via IWnet's P2P networking I never get a ping under 110 milliseconds and average about 180. It's almost as bad as when I used to play on dial-up years ago, although mildly better than dial-up due to \"anti-lag\" features introduced. Ping and latency issues aside, the game feels much like previous Infinity Ward produced Call of Duty games. However weapon balance is a bit questionable (to whether it even exists) and maps feel a bit cluttered. Balance via IWnet only occurs at the beginning of the round. If players drop from the game mid-match, teams can end up being 7vs2 with no way of evening it out. Rounds average 7-10 minutes, which is a bit short for my tastes. Steam integration is pretty cool. Being able to group up with friends is a plus. However, IWnet often fails and splits the group (whether it be host migration failure, random drop, or extreme lag), making it a bit of a hassle.

And don't IW is stripping long-standing consumer benefits with its PC game. Purchasing the game is nothing less than a declaration of your willingness to loss those benefits, and you're communicating that fact not just to IW, but to all of the publishers who are watching closely to see just how much they can get away with offering gamers a lesser exchange for their money. And don't pretend for a moment that this is just about PC gaming. The trend in all of gaming is away from game ownership and towards gaming as a rented service. The publishers' utopian wetdream is a market where the gamer owns nothing. They pay explicitly for every hour of gameplay they experience, and even then are only allowed to play within the strict and permanent boundaries erected by the publisher. And when the publisher decides you should stop playing an old game because it is no longer profitable enough, they terminate it and offer you the 'choice' of buying a new game, or to not play at all. I've read a lot of commentary that is dismissive if not outright disparaging of the passionate furor exhibited by a select few over the MW2 issue, saying things like, \"what's the problem, just let the market decide.\" Yes, absolutely, the market should decide, but don't \"let\" it happen. Realize that you, as a game-purchasing consumer, *ARE* the market. The market is nothing but the cumulative purchasing choices of all consumers. The only power you have as a consumer is to accept or reject the exchange offered by publishers. If you choose to purchase MW2, you are personally endorsing the continued erosion of value that gamers receive in their exchange with publishers. A lot of people think that they can complain about issues like this, but then buy the product anyway, and somehow that influences publishers to react to their complaints. The only thing that influences them is WHETHER OR NOT YOU BUY THE GAME! Bitching about something and buying the game is equivalent to buying the game and saying nothing -- it's equivalent even to buying the game and saying \"Great job guys, keep up the good work and be sure to strip away more of my consumer benefits next time.\" Because the only thing they hear is the sound of you purchasing the game - registering yet another gamer tacitly accepting reduced benefits, lowering the standard by which all publishers measure the market for all games. There are more games than I could play in a lifetime, and no single one of them is great enough that it's worth trading away the freedoms that I want to enjoy as a gamer. The only way I can compel publishers to respect and uphold those freedoms is by using my own incremental market vote to communicate the value of those freedoms, and to hope that others do the same in sufficient volume to convince publishers in no uncertain terms that it's more profitable to provide them than it is to take them away. …  Expand ", " I don't have to say much because ever body already knows the terrible things Infinity Ward has done to the PC experience.

Unfortunately, the storyline is terrible and completely forgettable - if you can even understand it in the first place. If COD4 was The Bourne Identity, MW2 is Transformers 2 - overblown in every way imaginable, without letting plot get in the way. But, I suppose that a Michael Bay-ish approach is to be expected given the dev team's obvious influence by The Rock. Multiplayer - for PC - is truly a let down. As I said before, the core gameplay is great and largely unchanged from COD4. In short, casual bursts, it's fun - which was the purported aim of IWnet. But the vastly limited options wax apparent the more you play. Despite the addition of a plethora of level ups, achievements, challenges, weapons and equipment, this game will not have the same life span COD4 did on PC. Many who are used to playing games on PC will grow tired of the shackles it places on gameplay before they finish unlocking everything. No choosing maps, number of players, hardcore for any game type, ping, etc. - only much simplified and generic playlists. After you pick the playlist, IWnet controls everything except for the part where you shoot things. Don't like \"Afghan\"? Tough luck - you can only start a vote that likely won't pass. Quit the server to find a new one and IWnet will very likely throw you back into the same one. It did this to me 3 consecutive times for one server (read: host player). Finally I relented and just put up with it, which is sort of allegorical of the IWnet experience as a whole. It reminds me of the old Ford Model T slogan: you can get any color you want, as long as it's black.\" Well, here \"you can play MW2 any way you like, as long as it's the way Vince Zampella intended it.\" Latency is often not terrible - until you notice its at-first subtle disadvantages. Get ready to watch plenty of killcam videos where you don't appear to have fired any of those final shots that you were sure hit the other guy between the eyes before he killed you. For me, this happens a lot and on even the \"fastest\" servers. P2P latency also introduces new controls. For example, the sprint key must be held down for at least a full second. Otherwise, you will start-stop sprint. These issues arrive because what you do on your PC takes a lot longer to get back to the host. What happens on their PC is the \"reality\" of the game, while you get a delayed version of that. So what kind of game type is P2P matchmaking just fine for? Two-player coop. Is matchmaking available in Special Ops mode? No. Invite only. If you don't have anyone on your friends list to invite (which isn't too unlikely given boycotts, jilted players, and the fact that the PC is much less populated to begin with), you can't play any of it two player, and the coolest missions require it. The reason I gave it a 5 is because the core game is great, and that's half the battle. But the implementation, the storytelling, the lack of a well-oiled multiplayer, etc. etc., is the other half. What good is a great game if playing it to your liking is such a headache? This is not an elitist thing. These features are a necessity on consoles, not a luxury. And things like P2P servers simply do not work as well on PCs. Without open source games, an open source platform is worthless. At some point in the last several months, IW decided to put MW2 in the back of the fridge and hand PC players MW2 Lite. I really hope my take on this is a \"to be continued ...\" and that IW at least throws PC a bone. They got a taste of console profits and now they want to either replicate that for PC (not possible) or edge the platform out altogether. We're the ones complaining now, but more and more, others will see. Talk of subscription fee models and additional for-pay content are starting to rise to the surface.

Once you get a killstreak, you will get an other killstreak, and especially when one team has the advantage, you can't break this cycle while your enemy is blowing you to bits.

I'm glad I went with my gut and bought this, because it was absolutely epic. I know people are peeved about the changes made to multiplayer--and perhaps rightly so. I'm not sure what IW was thinking (it does come off as traitorous), and I can't say I agree with the changes they've made, but that does not change the fact that this game is amazing. The campaign grips you and doesn't let go, moving through at lightning speed from beginning to end. A lot of people are commenting on and complaining about length--but when's the last time there was a campaign mode this jam-packed for 6 hours, without any filler? Are we looking for quality or quantity? If you're looking for quanity you can have it; I'll take quality and stick with MW2. It's only 6 hours long, but it's 6 hours of intense, meaningful gameplay--not to mention spec ops mode. Yes, there's lots of stuff blowing up, and perhaps some of the smarts have been sacrificed for spectacle--but that's not always a bad thing. The Hans Zimmer score is electrifying and there are more mind blowing twists and turns in this than you'd ever expect--most of them completely unpredictable. The sound is also improved upon, and the graphics were even better than I was expecting. This game is beautiful--don't let anyone tell you any different. As for multiplayer, I've only played a few games, but it's enough to have formulated an opinion. The action does seem a little bit slower, but much more balanced, and thus in a way more fun. My connection is super crappy, but even I have been able to get 3 bars in games where all the other players seemed to have 4. Maybe if you're from another part of the world (I'm from Canada, 2 hours NE of Toronto) you might have problems, but I havn't experienced any so far. The other aspects from MW1 multiplayer that we know and love have been amped up, built up, improved upon, and even replayability appears to have been extended. It's like MW1 multiplayer x 3, if you're able to get past the negativity surrounding the dedicated server issue. If you would rather focus on the negative (no dedicated servers, lean, mod support) instead of the positive (absolutely everything else) then don't buy this game. Otherwise, this is the shooter you've been waiting for. If you're on the edge like I was, think hard about it, consider the bitter \"DOA\" reviews by many of the upset fans here, and make an informed decision. I'm not saying the game is perfect (I would have given it a 9.5 given the option) but the reviews here are simply not legitimate. Might IW have screwed up partially on the multiplayer?

I was not impressed even for a moment with the glib single-player. The story was made for the express purpose of taking us from one location to the next and for creating moments that are supposed to be astonishing. But the truth is that every \"astonishing\" moment falls completely flat. With no connection to the characters and a nonsense plot, I felt like every \"epic\" scene was just a bad joke, such as the later D.C. level, the final showdown that made no sense, and the incredibly epic-fail, moronic \"No Russian\" level. Every time they went for that epic feel, I ended up saying to myself, \"You're kidding me, right?\" I do not mind the removal of prone in the latest military FPS games like MW2 and BF:BC2, because it is basically useless for the environments that the games take place in. But I ashamed that they have removed lean, which is used extensively in suitable combat situations in real life. I also do not like how the guns in the game feel like BB guns. They are too clickity-clickity. They do not feel like they have power and weight to them, nor that they are meant to kill people. BF:BC2 did a better job with the guns. The graphics are very consistent throughout, and they do look nice. But it is annoying knowing that they are so shader-crazy -- the textures and such are not nearly as detailed as you would think from looking at the game's bullshots. What I do like though is the game runs on the highest settings on my computer just fine, whereas BF:BC2 is so graphics-intensive that I have to set it to low to run it. So at least on my computer, MW2 looks a lot better, but if your computer can handle BC2 then it will look better on high settings, especially with DX11. The multiplayer is a style I do not like -- going solo usually, running and gunning, no squad system (or buddy system, as it should be for snipers), very arcade like. I prefer slightly more realistic (i.e. team-based) multiplayer shooters. This game makes it all a lot less realistic, because they want to maximize the fun, which does a major disservice to gamers by training them to think solo-minded. It trains them to think like noobs. Finally, the killstreaks are something that need to just disappear. They are more balanced here than in CoD4, but the problem with killstreaks at all is that they are inherently unbalanced. Giving hot-shot players even more firepower is just stupid, and giving those powers to those who are doing poorly wouldn't make sense either, so they should just be removed entirely. I have no comment on the lack of dedicated server support, except that I uninstalled the game and have no plans on reinstalling it unless there is an official patch to make the game friendly to hardcore gamers. …  Expand ", " Graphics and gameplay are smooth, but it's hard to say anymore good than this.

They took away everything that we took for granted.  They took away the private servers and gave us these gawd-awful public servers.  You get switched around from server to server mid-game, the latency in some games is terrible.  There's no private servers with admins to get rid of the trash talking 12 year-olds.  You can mute them, but that doesn't blur out their typed messages.  I have seen some hackers, but not nearly as many as all the whiners (and OMG there are a lot of whiners!) say there are.  There's no way to get rid of a hacker once you spot him, there's no report option or anything.  Then they charge 15$ for 5 new maps, 30$ for both map packs.  The maps are decent, but not great.  2 of the maps in both map packs are from the original Call of Duty: MW, so if you own that game you're in essence paying for maps which you already own.  They're charging for content updates, something that has historically always been free, and is still free in the Battlefield franchise, their main rival.  Here's my beef, Activision destroyed this franchise, literally.  They drove out the heads of Infiniward, the real developers behind this franchises' success.  All that Treyarch (their rival CoD makers) did was rip off the **** they came out with.

No counter to explosives. Every CoD has had a viable counter to explosives, now we have a game where explosives are super easy to use and in abundance (scavenger, OMA) and we only have Blast Shield!? Blast Shield didn't work half the time and you had to sacrifice equipment to use it. Epic fail on IW's part.

Besides, this is a multiplayer game basically, so unfortunely I'm forced to review the feature that I basically ignore. And besides, I was curious about the rumors of this game being \"the greatest online shooter ever\", and when I finally tried out the multiplayer one simple question bothered me: \"How?!\". I seriously never ever seen a game this badly thought and programmed: the maps are horrible (except for very few), filled with blind corners that actually can ruin easily the game; now, many maps have these blind corners, so I might think this was intentional, but when someone starts to win by just CAMPING, that is totally unacceptable, and even if i have to not count the blind corners the maps are still horrible, since they are basically thought for Free-for-All (and still, you can see campers killing you as soon as you spawn, not even giving you a proper spawn protection like in some games). Well, maps aren't the only bad thing, since also the \"class\" customization isn't very great either. The idea is actually good, of making your own class with perks and etc, not doubt on that, but unfortunely lots of these perks are totally downgrades instead of upgrades, so you'll just get the most convenient ones (Sleight of hand+Stopping power+Commando= you were good most of the times). And the Pro versions aren't a big deal either. The weapons are so-so: few are pretty good, some are mediocre, many are very weak; unfortunely I can't mention pros and cons of every weapon, but in general I never tried more than, maybe, 10 weapons in total and those few looked very similar too (the raffica pistol looked a lot like the FAMAS...only you can move faster while aiming instead), so I could be wrong too on this regard. And also, the killstreaks: the idea is actually great, but some can be highly annoying, but still I personally liked most of them. The deathstreaks are ok, but none is remarkable. Still, I'm sorry to say, this is and was one of the most boring online shooter I've ever played, with tons of bad concepts that turns the game into a camping race, weapons that are hardly worth your time (I even forgot the challenges...maybe a good thing?), and \"technically\" one mode, since most of the maps aren't well though for being anything else except Free-for-All. It's sad that I had to give this low score: When I heard of this game, I started to be curious and eventually I played, but to this day my question remains, and I doubt it will ever get answered, and now that there's Mw3 in the corner, and the bad scores it received, I guess my question might turn into this: \"Why?\". …  Expand ", " I really tried to like this, really I did! but once again turned out to be another tiny level console shooter with all it's focus on pushing teenagers egos up with dumb achievements and auto-aim gameplay...

It has to do with how bad they were at the game.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a very enjoyable game to play. The campaign is very fun and immersive. The storyline is easy to follow and not at all broken. The voice-acting and character personalities are also superb. The only problem with the gameplay of the campaign is it can get quite tedious, because you basically just shoot bad guys. The Spec-Ops missions are really cool. Spec-Ops missions are separated into five different categories, each category getting more difficult as you progress. These missions are based on maps from the campaign. They're pretty fun to play and they each have their own game style. Some are stealth missions, meaning you have to get through heaps of enemies silently. Others are survival, where you have to kill and just stay alive. Or you can race! There is also an option to do the missions with a friend.  The multiplayer is the reason a lot of people are giving it negative ratings. I honestly don't have a problem with it, and I'm not that great at it. I think the weapons for the most part are balanced. There are weapon mixtures (such as the G18 Akimbo) where they are very overpowered. But it's very fun and very enjoyable. The multiplayer has a load of different gamemodes, the most played are Team Deathmatch, Free-for-all, Domination, Ground War, and Search & Destroy. There are many weapons to unlock along with attachments for said weapons. There are also perks (Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3) to use to give your character a special boost. Now, of course there are cons. Among those are there is no dedicated servers. That makes many games laggy and unreliable. It's also easy to hack certain games, meaning your stats can get all screwed up.  The bottom line is this is a great game, contrary to popular belief. Awesome graphics, awesome game play. If you're skeptical, you could wait until it's on sale so you don't possibly waste your money. …  Expand ", " single player: literally no challenge, you can play it (even on veteran) in 2 hours or so co-ops: nothing special  multiplayer: this is the most offensive thing about this game, they abandon the servers a long time ago, the dlc maps, the community is awful etc  one just for the time invested playing this game, never again.

The portable turret defenses are a joke and don't kill anything. The actual gun turrets you can man at certain points on the map are self pronounced death traps. You can turn them basically 15 degrees each direction.....making them absolutely useless unless the enemy is standing right infront of you. Plus they do terrible damage and require a warmup and cooldown? The hell?! Total crap. Any heavy machine guns in this game are crap.
